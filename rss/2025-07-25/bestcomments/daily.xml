&lt;p&gt;This is a deeply concerning development, though not an entirely surprising one. While I sympathize with itch.io's position - being caught between their creators and their payment processors - the broader implications here are alarming.&lt;p&gt;Payment processors have effectively become unelected censorship boards with the power to strangle entire categories of &lt;i&gt;legal&lt;/i&gt; content by threatening to cut off the economic infrastructure that platforms depend on. The fact that a single advocacy campaign can pressure Visa/Mastercard/PayPal into forcing platforms to remove legal adult content should concern anyone who values free expression online.&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue isn't whether you personally approve of adult games or specific content - it's that a handful of payment companies now wield veto power over what legal content can exist in the digital economy. This represents a massive concentration of censorial authority in the hands of unaccountable corporate entities that face no meaningful democratic oversight.&lt;p&gt;We've seen this pattern repeatedly: PayPal blocking VPN providers over "piracy concerns," Visa suspending payments to adult sites, and now this coordinated pressure campaign. Each time, legal content gets effectively banned not through legislation or courts, but through corporate policy decisions made behind closed doors.&lt;p&gt;By inserting themselves as moral arbiters for the digital economy and free expression on the internet, these processors are creating a very strong case for being designated as common carriers or being subjected to much stricter public utility regulation. When payment infrastructure becomes as essential as electricity or telephone service for participating in the digital economy, treating these companies as neutral utilities rather than editorial boards becomes not just reasonable but necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great.&lt;p&gt;I set it up and was conspicuously swiping in bed.  My wife is all hey, what are you doing? I’m all nothing.. put the phone down on the dresser.&lt;p&gt;No, let me see your phone etc. I relent, she opens the app with sulphur smoldering in her nostrils lol, then she starts poking around, and we have been having a really great night since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the experience when clicking a link on mobile:&lt;p&gt;* Page loads, immediately when I start scrolling and reading a popup trying to get tracking consent&lt;p&gt;* If I am lucky, there is a "necessary only". When unlucky I need to click "manage options" and first see how to reject all tracking&lt;p&gt;* There is a sticky banner on top/bottom taking 20-30% of my screen upselling me a subscription or asking me to install their app. Upon pressing the tiny X in the corner it takes 1-2 seconds to close or multiple presses as I am either missing the x or because there is a network roundtrip&lt;p&gt;* I scroll down a screen and get a popup overlay asking me to signup for their service or newsleter, again messing with the x to close&lt;p&gt;* video or other flashy adds in the content keep bugging me&lt;p&gt;This is btw. usually all before I even established if the content is what I was looking for, or is at any way useful to me (often it is not).&lt;p&gt;If you use AI or Kagi summarizr, you get ad-free, well-formatted content without any annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am surprised how many people have so many problems with Firefox.&lt;p&gt;I've never felt impeded by loading speeds, and my ADHD regularly has me forgetting to restart it, to the tune of 100+ tabs open across multiple desktops. My wimply little MacBook Pro doesn't seem to mind.&lt;p&gt;The only downside I've found is that, because so many people just default to "Chrome or nothing," there's occasionally sites that have bugs because, like was the case in the 90s with Internet Explorer, the site developers took the idiomatic Chrome way of building a feature instead of something universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in manufacturing in the US. Incoming quality control, for Chinese vendors, is &lt;i&gt;necessarily&lt;/i&gt; set up with zero-trust. This isn't a "trust but verify" sort of thing, it's strictly "do not trust". Assume that, at every step of the chain, there will be a lie: change of process, material change, collected data, and that the product being given to you is even yours (delivering a knockoff at the final step, and reselling yours on the gray market).&lt;p&gt;This is all common knowledge, proven by example after example that it's &lt;i&gt;necessary&lt;/i&gt; to have zero trust. It's truly an adversarial system. All the extra engineering effort for IQC is still cheaper. And, there's rarely an alternative to the amazing manufacturing ecosystem that is China.&lt;p&gt;After tracking down several of these types of issues, it appears that the Chabuduo mindset [1] is a very real thing.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32465780"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32465780&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW this has caused a big storm in China. The root of the issue is known to be caused by the battery cell vendor Amprius changing the battery design w/o notifying the power bank manufacturers. AFAIKT Amprius lost the 3C certification (a certification in China) because of this incident.&lt;p&gt;This is one of the Chinese reports on the issue: 
&lt;a href="https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_31048287" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_31048287&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excerpt from the report above (translated using Google):&lt;p&gt;&gt; The Paper learned from an insider that Anker Innovations' battery cell supplier is already a leading battery cell supplier in the industry, and did not inform customers after it changed materials. In addition to Anker Innovations, the supplier also cooperates with leading power bank brands, so the impact is huge. Although Anker Innovations did not name the supplier, an insider pointed out that the supplier was Amprius.&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;p&gt;There's an exclusive interview by 36kr with one of Anker's VPs:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.36kr.com/p/3365435892680709" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://m.36kr.com/p/3365435892680709&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan here. I used to compete in the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics), back in the '90s.&lt;p&gt;I aced the competition in Sri Lanka, but I failed to win a medal the first time I competed internationally. I solved several problems with recursion, but these failed to complete within the strict time limits allowed.&lt;p&gt;One of the contestants from another country told me: "You needed dynamic programming to solve problems 1 and 5." I then spent the next year trying to figure out what dynamic programming was. The folks over here weren't familiar with the term. In fact, I was often asked "did you mean dynamic memory allocation?"&lt;p&gt;After a while, I managed to find a book that talked about dynamic programming, and I was like "Oh, it's recursion + storing results" and "Ah, you can also do this iteratively in certain circumstances"&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, armed with this new knowledge, I ended up winning a gold medal at IOI 2001. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For whatever reason, evolution decided those wavelengths should be overlapping. For example, M cones are most sensitive to 535 nm light, while L cones are most sensitive to 560 nm light. But M cones are still stimulated quite a lot by 560 nm light—around 80% of maximum.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple: genes coding the long wave opsins (light-sensitive proteins) in these cones have diverged from copies of the same original gene. The evolution of this is very interesting.&lt;p&gt;Mammals in general have only two types of cones: presumably they lost full color vision in the age of dinosaurs since they were primarily small nocturnal animals or lived in habitats with very limited light (subterranean, piles of leaves, etc.) Primates are the notable exception, and have evolved the third type of cone, enabling trichromatic color vision, as a result of their fruitarian specialization and co-evolution with the tropical fruit trees (same as birds, actually).&lt;p&gt;So, what's interesting is that New World and Old World primates evolved this cone independently. In Old World primates the third cone resulted from a gene duplication event on the X chromosome, giving rise to two distinct (but pretty similar) opsin genes, with sensitivity peaks at very close wavelengths. As a note, because these genes sit on the X chromosome, colorblindness (defects in one or both of these genes) is much more likely to happen in males.&lt;p&gt;New World primates have a single polymorphic opsin gene on the X chromosome, with different alleles coding for different sensitivities. So, only some (heterozygous) females in these species typically have full trichromatic vision, while males and the unlucky homozygous females remain dichromatic.&lt;p&gt;Decent wikipedia article on the subject: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_color_vision_in_primates" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_color_vision_in_p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of opsins in vertebrates:

&lt;p&gt;Many comments here are arguing that quality has actually gone up over the past decades. However, a common experience for me is that I own something of good quality from 5/10/15 years ago and now buy the successor model from the same brand, but the product has gotten worse, being cheaper made. And I have a hard time finding a replacement that matches the quality of the old version. It’s a regularly reoccurring frustration.&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that when products are successful and mature but reach market saturation, profit growth pressure leads to cutting some corners on every iteration, and hence to a slow decline in quality over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; The amount of cognitive overhead in this deceptively simple log is several levels deep: you have to first stop to type logger.info (or is it logging.info? I use both loguru and logger depending on the codebase and end up always getting the two confused.) Then, the parentheses, the f-string itself, and then the variables in brackets. Now, was it your_variable or your_variable_with_edits from five lines up? And what’s the syntax for accessing a subset of df.head again?&lt;p&gt;What you're describing is called: programming. This can't be serious. What about the cognitive overhead of writing a for loop? You have to remember what's in the array you're iterating over, how that array interacts with maybe other parts of the code base, and oh man, what about those pesky indices! Does it start at 0 or 1? I can't take it! AI save me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "spreadsheet" example video is kind of funny: guy talks about how it normally takes him 4 to 8 hours to put together complicated, data-heavy reports. Now he fires off an agent request, goes to walk his dog, and comes back to a downloadable spreadsheet of dense data, which he pulls up and says "I think it got 98% of the information correct... I just needed to copy / paste a few things. If it can do 90 - 95% of the time consuming work, that will save you a ton of time"&lt;p&gt;It feels like either finding that 2% that's off (or dealing with 2% error) will be the time consuming part in a lot of cases. I mean, this is nothing new with LLMs, but as these use cases encourage users to input more complex tasks, that are more integrated with our personal data (and at times money, as hinted at by all the "do task X and buy me Y" examples), "almost right" seems like it has the potential to cause a lot of headaches. Especially when the 2% error is subtle and buried in step 3 of 46 of some complex agentic flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for a home builder. Our single biggest problem is finding and hiring quality contractors that have enough skilled tradesmen.&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of electrical contractors in my area. But only two that perform work to our standards.&lt;p&gt;There is only one HVAC company that can meet our standards. Same for all of the other skilled trades.&lt;p&gt;Our framing crew is the best within a 75 mile radius. Other builders are constantly trying to poach them from us. We keep throwing money at them to prevent them from going to another builder.&lt;p&gt;Non skilled labor like landscaping and pest control are a dime a dozen. I just fired our main pesticide and herbicide contractor today because they couldn’t get it together.&lt;p&gt;Of course I had them replaced before I fired them but I had almost 20 options to choose from.&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I can’t say the same about all of the skilled contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

So is a solid chunk of this the people that would have already had Linux desktops continuing to have theirs since they would likely be the same people (more technical, needing to do tasks not possible on phones and tablets) less likely to be making that switch.&lt;p&gt;Basically if the higher percent is due to less desktops overall instead of a major uptick in Linux desktops, it is not really much to celebrate.&lt;p&gt;Given these numbers are percents I would be very curious.&lt;p&gt;Now yes there is a clear uptick thanks to the Steam Deck (however with Microsoft pushing their optimized for gaming Windows it will be interesting to see if that continues or goes backwards). But I would be reluctant to call that Linux Desktop anymore than I would call Android an uptick for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in the refurb division of an e-waste recycling company. Due to licensing costs and our certifications, we can't sell anything with Windows. My coworkers install Ubuntu, but I install Linux Mint. We don't have any clue if people keep using Linux or install Windows, but it's cool to think we're helping to move this needle.&lt;p&gt;Edit: might as well link to the merch: &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/evolutionecycling" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.ebay.com/str/evolutionecycling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are plenty of more serious issues people have with Mozilla's direction and focus, but patronizing stuff like this really grinds my gears.&lt;p&gt;&gt; Which animal best represents your Firefox browsing style? [List of emoji animals]&lt;p&gt;The marketing/PR trend of speaking to communities as though they're kindergartners is distracting and off-putting. This is the most egregious part but the whole post has a similar tone.&lt;p&gt;I'll note that I'm not saying outreach should necessarily be professional or devoid of fun/humor. There's just a sterile, saccharine way about Mozilla's community engagement that evokes artificiality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 90s a friend told me about the internet. And that he knows someone who is in a university and has access to it and can show us. An hour later, we were sitting in front of a computer in that university and watched his friend surfing the web. Clicking on links, receiving pages of text. Faster than one could read. In a nice layout. Even with images. And links to other pages. We were shocked. No printing, no shipping, no waiting. This was the future. It was inevitable.&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wanted to rewrite a program to use a large library that would have required me to dive deep down into the documentation or read its code to tackle my use case. As a first try, I just copy+pasted the whole library and my whole program into GPT 4.1 and told it to rewrite it using the library. It succeeded at the first attempt. The rewrite itself was small enough that I could read all code changes in 15 minutes and make a few stylistic changes. Done. Hours of time saved. This is the future. It is inevitable.&lt;p&gt;PS: Most replies seem to compare my experience to experiences that the responders have with agentic coding, where the developer is iteratively changing the code by chatting with an LLM. I am not doing that. I use a "One prompt one file. No code edits." approach, which I describe here:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gibney.org/prompt_coding" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.gibney.org/prompt_coding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think two things can be true simultaneously:&lt;p&gt;1. LLMs are a new technology and it's hard to put the genie back in the bottle with that. It's difficult to imagine a future where they don't continue to exist in some form, with all the timesaving benefits and social issues that come with them.&lt;p&gt;2. Almost three years in, companies investing in LLMs have not yet discovered a business model that justifies the massive expenditure of training and hosting them, the majority of consumer usage is at the free tier, the industry is seeing the first signs of pulling back investments, and model capabilities are plateauing at a level where most people agree that the output is trite and unpleasant to consume.&lt;p&gt;There are many technologies that have seemed inevitable and seen retreats under the lack of commensurate business return (the supersonic jetliner), and several that seemed poised to displace both old tech and labor but have settled into specific use cases (the microwave oven). Given the lack of a sufficiently profitable business model, it feels as likely as not that LLMs settle somewhere a little less remarkable, and hopefully less annoying, than today's almost universally disliked attempts to cram it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: movie sales, in terms of tickets sold, peaked in 2002. [1] All the 'box office records' since then are the result of charging way more to a continually plummeting audience size.&lt;p&gt;And this is highly relevant for things like this. People often argue that if movies were so bad then people would stop watching them, unaware that people actually have stopped watching them!&lt;p&gt;Even for individual movies. For all the men-in-spandex movies, the best selling movie (by tickets sold) in modern times is Titanic, 27 years ago.&lt;p&gt;[1] - &lt;a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.the-numbers.com/market/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the amount of turmoil around these deals is giving more weight to the possibility that we’re in a massive bubble thats quite divorced from any kind of fundamentals. Sooner or later the bubbles gonna burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law enforcement agencies which behaved the way law enforcement agencies always behave and did what anyone with even the slightest familiarity with how law enforcement acts thought they would do with the data.  This outcome was 1000% predictable even if the details were not.&lt;p&gt;If you're gonna be angry at someone be angry at the people among us were in favor of the creation of this data set because they foolishly thought it would be used to combat mundane property crime or because perhaps they thought that subjecting motorists to an increased dragnet would be a good thing for alternative transportation, or some other cause, think that they have done no wrong despite warnings of the potential for something like this being raised way back when the cameras and the ALPRs were being put up.&lt;p&gt;These things will keep happening until it is no longer socially acceptable to advocate for the creation of data collection programs that are a necessary precondition.&lt;/p&gt;
