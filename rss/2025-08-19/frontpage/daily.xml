&lt;p&gt;I'm Taylor, I spent about a year as a Fractional Head of Product. It was my first time not in a full-time W2 role, and I quickly learned that the hardest part of the job wasn't doing the Product work (I was a PM for 10+ years), it was finding good clients to work with.&lt;p&gt;So I built Fractional Jobs.&lt;p&gt;The goal is to help more people break out of W2 life and into their own independent careers by helping them find great clients to work with.&lt;p&gt;We find and vet the clients, and then engineers can request intros to any that seem like a good fit. We'll make the intro assuming the client opts in after seeing your profile.&lt;p&gt;We have 9 open engineering roles right now:
- 2x Fractional CTO
- 2x AI engineers
- 3x full-stack
- 1x staff frontend 
- 1x mobile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to do something very challenging to prove to ourselves that we can do anything we put our mind to. The reasoning for why we chose to build a toy TPU specifically is fairly simple:&lt;p&gt;- Building a chip for ML workloads seemed cool
- There was no well-documented open source repo for an ML accelerator that performed both inference and training&lt;p&gt;None of us have real professional experience in hardware design, which, in a way, made the TPU even more appealing since we weren't able to estimate exactly how difficult it would be. As we worked on the initial stages of this project, we established a strict design philosophy: TO ALWAYS TRY THE HACKY WAY. This meant trying out the "dumb" ideas that came to our mind first BEFORE consulting external sources. This philosophy helped us make sure we weren't reverse engineering the TPU, but rather re-inventing it, which helped us derive many of the key mechanisms used in the TPU ourselves.&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to treat this project as an exercise to code without relying on AI to write for us, since we felt that our initial instinct recently has been to reach for llms whenever we faced a slight struggle. We wanted to cultivate a certain style of thinking that we could take forward with us and use in any future endeavours to think through difficult problems.&lt;p&gt;Throughout this project we tried to learn as much as we could about the fundamentals of deep learning, hardware design and creating algorithms and we found that the best way to learn about this stuff is by drawing everything out and making that our first instinct. In tinytpu.com, you will see how our explanations were inspired by this philosophy.&lt;p&gt;Note that this is NOT a 1-to-1 replica of the TPU--it is our attempt at re-inventing a toy version of it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi HN! We’re Max and Peyton from The Interface (&lt;a href="https://www.theinterface.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.theinterface.com/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;p&gt;We started out building an AI agent dev tool, but somewhere along the way it turned into Sims for AI agents.&lt;p&gt;Demo video: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRPnX_f2V_c" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRPnX_f2V_c&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The original idea was simple: make it easy to create AI agents. We started with Jupyter Notebooks, where each cell could be callable by MCP—so agents could turn them into tools for themselves. It worked well enough that the system became self-improving, churning out content, and acting like a co-pilot that helped you build new agents.&lt;p&gt;But when we stepped back, what we had was these endless walls of text. And even though it worked, honestly, it was just boring. We were also convinced that it would be swallowed up by the next model’s capabilities. We wanted to build something else—something that made AI less of a black box and more engaging. Why type into a chat box all day if you could look your agents in the face, see their confusion, and watch when and how they interact?&lt;p&gt;Both of us grew up on simulation games—RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Age of Empires, SimCity—so we started experimenting with running LLM agents inside a 3D world. At first it was pure curiosity, but right away, watching agents interact in real time was much more interesting than anything we’d done before.&lt;p&gt;The very first version was small: a single Unity room, an MCP server, and a chat box. Even getting two agents to take turns took weeks. Every run surfaced quirks—agents refusing to talk at all, or only “speaking” by dancing or pulling facial expressions to show emotion. That unpredictability kept us building.&lt;p&gt;Now it’s a desktop app (Tauri + Unity via WebGL) where humans and agents share 3D tile-based rooms. Agents receive structured observations every tick and can take actions that change the world. You can edit the rules between runs—prompts, decision logic, even how they see chat history—without rebuilding.&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, we built a Unity bridge with MCP and multi-provider routing via LiteLLM, with local model support via Mistral.rs coming next. All system prompts are editable, so you can directly experiment with coordination strategies—tuning how “chatty” agents are versus how much they move or manipulate the environment.&lt;p&gt;We then added a tilemap editor so you can design custom rooms, set tile-based events with conditions and actions, and turn them into puzzles or hazards. There’s community sharing built in, so you can post rooms you make.&lt;p&gt;Watching agents collude or negotiate through falling tiles, teleports, landmines, fire, “win” and “lose” tiles, and tool calls for things like lethal fires or disco floors is a much more fun way to spend our days.&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Unity’s ECS drives a whole state machine and event system. And because humans and AI share the same space in real time, every negotiation, success, or failure also becomes useful multi-agent, multimodal data for post-training or world models.&lt;p&gt;Our early users are already using it for prompt-injection testing, social engineering scenarios, cooperative games, and model comparisons.
The bigger vision is to build an open-ended, AI-native sim-game where you can build and interact with anything or anyone. You can design puzzles, levels, and environments, have agents compete or collaborate, set up games, or even replay your favorite TV shows.&lt;p&gt;The fun part is that no two interactions are ever the same. Everything is emergent, not hard-coded, so the same level played six times will play out differently each time.&lt;p&gt;The plan is to keep expanding—bigger rooms, more in-world tools for agents, and then multiplayer hosting. It’s live now, no waitlist. Free to play. You can bring your own API keys, or start with $10 in credits and run agents right away: www.TheInterface.com.&lt;p&gt;We’d love feedback on scenarios worth testing and what to build next. Tell us the weird stuff you’d throw at this—we’ll be in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey HN! Braden here, creator of Whispering, an open-source speech-to-text app.&lt;p&gt;I really like dictation. For years, I relied on transcription tools that were &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; good, but they were all closed-source. Even a lot of them that claimed to be “local” or “on-device” were still black boxes that left me wondering where my audio really went.&lt;p&gt;So I built Whispering. It’s open-source, local-first, and most importantly, transparent with your data.   All your data is stored locally on your device. For me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).&lt;p&gt;Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid, closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office.&lt;p&gt;Here’s an overview: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s how I personally am using it with Claude Code these days: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpix588SeiQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpix588SeiQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of transcription apps out there, but I hope Whispering adds some extra competition from the OSS ecosystem (one of my other OSS favorites is Handy &lt;a href="https://github.com/cjpais/Handy" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/cjpais/Handy&lt;/a&gt;). Whispering has a few tricks up its sleeve, like a voice-activated mode for hands-free operation (no button holding), and customizable AI transformations with any prompt/model.&lt;p&gt;Whispering used to be in my personal GH repo, but I recently moved it as part of a larger project called Epicenter (&lt;a href="https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter&lt;/a&gt;), which I should explain a bit...&lt;p&gt;I’m basically obsessed with local-first open-source software. I think there should be an open-source, local-first version of every app, and I would like them all to work together. The idea of Epicenter is to store your data in a folder of plaintext and SQLite, and build a suite of interoperable, local-first tools on top of this shared memory. Everything is totally transparent, so you can trust it.&lt;p&gt;Whispering is the first app in this effort. It’s not there yet regarding memory, but it’s getting there. I’ll probably write more about the bigger picture soon, but mainly I just want to make software and let it speak for itself (no pun intended in this case!), so this is my Show HN for now.&lt;p&gt;I just finished college and was about to move back with my parents and work on this instead of getting a job…and then I somehow got into YC. So my current plan is to cover my living expenses and use the YC funding to support maintainers, our dependencies, and people working on their own open-source local-first projects. More on that soon.&lt;p&gt;Would love your feedback, ideas, and roasts. If you would like to support the project, star it on GitHub here (&lt;a href="https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter&lt;/a&gt;) and join the Discord here (&lt;a href="https://go.epicenter.so/discord"&gt;https://go.epicenter.so/discord&lt;/a&gt;). Everything’s MIT licensed, so fork it, break it, ship your own version, copy whatever you want!&lt;/p&gt;
