&lt;p&gt;&gt; importers must declare the exact amount of steel, copper, and aluminum in products, with a 100% tariff applied to these materials. This makes little sense—PCBs, for instance, contain copper traces, but the quantity is nearly impossible to estimate.&lt;p&gt;Wow this administration is f**ing batshit insane. I thought the tariffs would be on raw metals, not anything at all that happens to contain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning to use your device you need to have a contractual relationship with a foreign (unless you are in the US) third party that decides what you can or cannot do with it. Plus using GrapheneOS is less of an option every day, since banks and other "regulated" sectors use Google Play Protect and similar DRMs to prevent you from connecting from whatever device you want. Client-side "trust" means the provider owning the device, not the user.&lt;p&gt;Android shouldn't be considered Open Source anymore, since source code is published in batches and only part of the system is open, with more and more apps going behind the Google ecosystem itself.&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time for a third large phone OS, whether it comes from China getting fed up with the US and Google's shenanigans (Huawei has HarmonyOS but it's not open) or some "GNU/Linux" touch version that has a serious ecosystem. Especially when more and more apps and services are "mobile-first" or "mobile-only" like banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is Stallman started his fight like half a century ago and on regular days Hacker News shits on him eating something off of his foot and not being polished and diplomatic, and loves practical aspects of Corporate Open Source and gratis goodies and doesn't particularly care about Free Software.&lt;p&gt;On this day suddenly folks come out of the woodwork advocating for  half baked measures to achieve what Stallman portrayed but they still hardly recognize this was EXACTLY his concern when he started the Free Software movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a thing then the solution they offer is incorrect. A big giant red screen: “warning the identity of this application developer has not been verified and this could be an application stealing your data, etc” would have worked.&lt;p&gt;What they want is to get rid of apps like YouTube Vanced that are making them lose money (and other Play Store apps)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really bad. I think that most people on HN will agree with that.&lt;p&gt;The problem is that most &lt;i&gt;normal&lt;/i&gt; people (HN is not normal - mostly for the better) don't even &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; what sideloading is - let alone actually &lt;i&gt;care&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;How can we fix this?&lt;p&gt;(aside from making people care - apathy enables so many political problems in the current age, but it's such a huge problem that &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; definitely isn't going to be the impetus to fix it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely unacceptable. That's like you having to submit your personal details to Microsoft in order to just run a program on Windows. Absolutely nuts and it will not go as they think it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the worst thing to happen to technology in recent times since there is only two major phone OS's.&lt;p&gt;It isn't possible to ban encryption, so the governments have to chip away at security and privacy using these techniques.&lt;p&gt;From: &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://developer.android.com/developer-verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You may also need to upload official government ID."&lt;p&gt;This won't end well for Google or the governments involved when the people get so angry that they are forced to roll this back. Switch to an alternative phone OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people missing the irony here, the term “metaverse,” that Meta is named after, was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 book “Snow Crash.”&lt;p&gt;In the book, the metaverse is a VR version of the internet with an emphasis on accurate sword fights and realistic facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's it then.&lt;p&gt;If this actually goes through, there will be no option in the mobile OS market for an OS that both:&lt;p&gt;a) allows the installation of apps without any contractual relationship with any party, and&lt;p&gt;b) allows the use of mainstream and secure apps like banking&lt;/p&gt;

The way I see it, this is nothing but a power grab, a way for Google to kill apps like Revanced for good. They'll just find some bullshit reason to suspend your developer account if you do something they don't like.&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear mentions of "safety" from the folks at Google, I'm reminded that there's a hidden Internet permission on Android that can neuter 95% of malicious apps. But it's hidden, apparently because keeping users from using it to block ads on apps is of greater concern to Google than keeping people safe.&lt;p&gt;&gt; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from&lt;p&gt;This is such an odd statement. I mean, surely they have to be willing to review the contents of apps at &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; point (if only to suspend the accounts of developers who are actually producing malware), or else this whole affair does nothing but introduce friction.&lt;p&gt;TFA had me believing that bypassing the restriction might've been possible by disabling Play Protect, but that doesn't seem to be the case since there aren't any mentions of it in the official info we've been given.&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, that's one less platform I care about supporting with my projects. We're down to just Linux and Windows if you're not willing to sell your soul (no, I will not be making a Google account) just for the right to develop for a certain platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely do not understand where how the idea of building a total surveillance police state, where all speech is monitored, can even as much as seriously be considered by an allegedly pro-democracy, pro-human rights government, much less make it into law.&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Build mass surveillance to prevent the 'bad guys' from coming into political power (its ok, we're the good guys).&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Your political opponents capitalize on your genuinely horrific overreach, and legitimize themselves in the eyes of the public as fighting against tyranny (unfortunately for you they do have a point). They promise to dismantle the system if coming to power.&lt;p&gt;Step 3: They get elected.&lt;p&gt;Step 4: They don't dismantle the system, now the people you planned to use the system against are using it against you.&lt;p&gt;Sounds brilliant, lets do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about this post is that it highlights something a lot of devs gloss over: the coding part of game development was never really the bottleneck. A solo developer can crank out mechanics pretty quickly, with or without AI. The real grind is in all the invisible layers on top; balancing the loop, tuning difficulty, creating assets that don’t look uncanny, and building enough polish to hold someone’s attention for more than 5 minutes.&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re not suddenly drowning in brilliant Steam releases post-LLMs. The tech has lowered one wall, but the taller walls remain. It’s like the rise of Unity in the 2010s: the engine democratized making games, but we didn’t see a proportional explosion of good game, just more attempts. LLMs are doing the same thing for code, and image models are starting to do it for art, but neither can tell you if your game is actually fun.&lt;p&gt;The interesting question to me is: what happens when AI can not only implement but also playtest -- running thousands of iterations of your loop, surfacing which mechanics keep simulated players engaged? That’s when we start moving beyond "AI as productivity hack" into "AI as collaborator in design." We’re not there yet, but this article feels like an early data point along that trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a a new kind of job for software engineers, sort of like a cross between working with legacy code and toxic site cleanup.&lt;p&gt;Like back in the day being brought in to “just fix” a amalgam of FoxPro-, Excel-, and Access-based ERP that “mostly works” and only “occasionally corrupts all our data” that ambitious sales people put together over last 5 years.&lt;p&gt;But worse - because “ambitious sales people” will no longer be constrained by sandboxes of Excel or Access - they will ship multi-cloud edge-deployed kubernetes micro-services wired with Kafka, and it will be harder to find someone to talk to understand what they were trying to do at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka isn’t a queue, it’s a distributed log. A partitioned topic can take very large volumes of message writes, persist them indefinitely, deliver them to any subscriber in-order and at-least-once (even for subscribers added after the message was published), and do all of that distributed and HA.&lt;p&gt;If you need all those things, there just are not a lot of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general I would rather the government take a stake in corporations they're bailing out. I think the "too big to fail" bailouts in the past should have come with more of a cost for the business, so on one hand I'm glad this is finally happening.&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I wish it were a more formalized process rather than this politicized "our president made a deal to save america!" / "Intel is back and the government is investing BUY INTEL SHARES" media event. These things should follow a strict set of rules and processes so investors and companies know what to expect. These kind of deals should be boring, not a media event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using Go more or less in every full-time job I've had since pre-1.0. It's simple for people on the team to pick up the basics, it generally chugs along (I'm rarely worried about updating to latest version of Go), it has most useful things built in, it compiles fast. Concurrency is tricky but if you spend some time with it, it's nice to express data flow in Go. The type system is most of the time very convenient, if sometimes a bit verbose. Just all-around a trusty tool in the belt.&lt;p&gt;But I can't help but agree with a lot of points in this article. Go was designed by some old-school folks that maybe stuck a bit too hard to their principles, losing sight of the practical conveniences. That said, it's a _feeling_ I have, and maybe Go would be much worse if it had solved all these quirks. To be fair, I see more leniency in fixing quirks in the last few years, like at some point I didn't think we'd ever see generics, or custom iterators, etc.&lt;p&gt;The points about RAM and portability seem mostly like personal grievances though. If it was better, that would be nice, of course. But the GC in Go is very unlikely to cause issues in most programs even at very large scale, and it's not that hard to debug. And Go runs on most platforms anyone could ever wish to ship their software on.&lt;p&gt;But yeah the whole error / nil situation still bothers me. I find myself wishing for Result[Ok, Err] and Optional[T] quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article gave me more appreciation for the stance of the Linux community.&lt;p&gt;So to sum up. Valorant's anti-cheat, which the author sees something like an ideal solution:&lt;p&gt;- starts up and loads its kernel driver on boot.&lt;p&gt;- generates a persistent unique ID based on hardware serial numbers and associates this with my game account.&lt;p&gt;- stays active the entire time the system is up, whether I play the game or not. But don't worry, it only does some unspecified logging.&lt;p&gt;- is somehow not a spyware or data protection risk at all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; At the end of it, they were sketching a completely different architecture without my "PMing". Because they finally understood who was actually using our product.&lt;p&gt;I cannot help but read this whole experience as: “We forced an engineer to take sales calls and we found out that the issue was that our PMs are doing a terrible job communicating between customer and engineering, and our DevOps engineer is more capable/actionable at turning customer needs into working solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely agree.&lt;p&gt;On a side note.. ya’ll must be prompt wizards if you can actually use the LLM code.&lt;p&gt;I use it for debugging sometimes to get an idea, or a quick sketch up of an UI.&lt;p&gt;As for actual code.. the code it writes is a huge mess of spaghetti code, overly verbose, with serious performance and security risks, and complete misunderstanding of pretty much every design pattern I give it..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He wants educators to instead teach “how do you think and how do you decompose problems”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahmen! I attend this same church.&lt;p&gt;My favorite professor in engineering school always gave open book tests.&lt;p&gt;In the real world of work, everyone has full access to all the available data and information.&lt;p&gt;Very few jobs involve paying someone simply to look up data in a book or on the internet. What they will pay for is someone who can analyze, understand, reason and apply data and information in unique ways needed to solve problems.&lt;p&gt;Doing this is called "engineering". And this is what this professor taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a usually technical crowd, so I can't help but wonder if many people genuinely don't get it, or if they are just feigning a lack of understanding to be dismissive of Anubis.&lt;p&gt;Sure, the people who make the AI scraper bots are going to figure out how to actually do the work. The point is that they hadn't, and this worked for quite a while.&lt;p&gt;As the botmakers circumvent, new methods of proof-of-notbot will be made available.&lt;p&gt;It's really as simple as that. If a new method comes out and your site is safe for a month or two, great! That's better than dealing with fifty requests a second, wondering if you can block whole netblocks, and if so, which.&lt;p&gt;This is like those simple things on submission forms that ask you what 7 + 2 is. Of course everyone knows that a crawler can calculate that! But it takes a human some time and work to tell the crawler HOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people at Google seem to think much more like me than the people at Apple.&lt;p&gt;There are 3 primary decisions Google made that click with me, while Apple's choices are a mystery to me:&lt;p&gt;1: When I put a Pixel on a table, it sits there stable. Because the backside is symmetrical. When I put an iPhone on a table, it wobbles.&lt;p&gt;2: When I sort my photos on a Pixel, I sort them in folders. The "camera" folder is where the unsorted photos are. When I sit in a bus or in a cafe, I go through it and sort the new photos into folders. This seems impossible on iPhones. Everything stays in the main folder forever. You can add photos to albums, but that does not remove them from the main folder. So there is no way to know which photos I have already sorted.&lt;p&gt;3: On Android I can use Chrome. Which means web apps can use the File System Access API. This makes web apps first class productivity applications I can use to work on my local files. Impossible on iPhones.&lt;p&gt;I'm sure people who prefer iPhones have their own set of "this clicks with me on iPhones and puzzles me on Pixels" aspects?&lt;p&gt;Is this a "left brain vs right brain" type of thing? Do most HNers prefer Androids?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the spirit of Zed. From the principles to the low-level implementation details, it all screams "good taste". It's immensely interesting as an object of study (the code is great, from GPUI all the way up).&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I don't think an editor should be VC backed. It's the obvious pragmatic choice to get a team together to support a thing, but I'm concerned by it.&lt;/p&gt;
