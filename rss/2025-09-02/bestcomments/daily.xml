&lt;p&gt;I think the conversation needs to change from "can't run software of our choice" to "can't participate in society without an apple or google account". I have been living with a de-googled android phone for a number of years, and it is getting harder and harder, while at the same time operating without certain "apps" is becoming more difficult.&lt;p&gt;For example, by bank (abn amro) still allows online banking on desktop via a physical auth device, but they are actively pushing for login only via their app. I called their support line for a lost card, and had to go through to second level support because I didn't have the app. If they get their way, eventually an apple or google account will be mandatory to have a bank account with them.&lt;p&gt;My kid goes to a school that outsourced all communication via an app. They have a web version, but it's barely usable. The app doesn't run without certain google libs installed. Again, to participate in school communication about my kid effectively requires an apple or google account.&lt;p&gt;I feel like the conversation we should be having is that we are sleepwalking into a world where to participate in society you must have an account with either apple or google. If you decide you don't want a relationship with either of those companies you will be extremely disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; In this context this would mean having the ability and documentation to build or install alternative operating systems on this hardware&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work. Everything from banks to Netflix and others are slowly edging out anything where they can't fully verify the chain of control to an entity they can have a legal or contractual relationship with. To be clear, this is fundamental, not incidental. You can't run your own operating system because it's not in Netflix's financial interest for you to do so. Or your banks, or your government. They all benefit from you not having control, so you can't.&lt;p&gt;This is why it's so important to defend the real principles here not just the technical artefacts of them. Netflix shouldn't be able to insist on a particular type of DRM for me to receive their service. Governments shouldn't be able to prevent me from end to end encrypting things. I should be able to opt into all this if I want more security, but it can't be mandatory. However all of these things are not technical, they are principles and rights that we have to argue for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"sideloading" connotates something that is negative.&lt;p&gt;On systems before apple's locked-down iphone, it was just called "installing".&lt;p&gt;The PC revolution started with people just inserting their software into the comptuer and running it.  You didn't have to ask the computer manufacturer or the OS vendor permission to do it.&lt;p&gt;And note that apple doesn't allow you to protect yourself.  You cannot install a firewall and block arbitrary software on your phone.  For example, you can not block apple telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the classic misunderstanding where software engineers can't seem to communicate well with each other.&lt;p&gt;We can even just look at the title here: Do the simplest thing POSSIBLE.&lt;p&gt;You can't escape complexity when a problem is complex.  You could certainly still complicate it even more than necessary, though.  Nowhere in this article is it saying you can avoid complexity altogether, but that many of us tend to over-complicate problems for no good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this works in simple domains. After working in big tech for a while, I am still shocked by the required complexity. Even the simplest business problem may take a year to solve, and constantly break due to the astounding number of edge cases and scale.&lt;p&gt;Anyone proclaiming simplicity just hasnt worked at scale. Even rewrites that have a decade old code base to be inspired from, often fail due to the sheer amount of things to consider.&lt;p&gt;A classic, Chesterton's Fence:&lt;p&gt;"There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tested this yesterday with Cline. It's fast, works well with agentic flows, and produces decent code. No idea why this thread is so negative (also got flagged while I was typing this?) but it's a decent model. I'd say it's at or above gpt5-mini level, which is awesome in my book (I've been maining gpt5-mini for a few weeks now, does the job on a budget).&lt;p&gt;Things I noted:&lt;p&gt;- It's fast. I tested it in EU tz, so ymmv&lt;p&gt;- It does agentic in an interesting way. Instead of editing a file whole or in many places, it does many small passes.&lt;p&gt;- Had a feature take ~110k tokens (parsing html w/ bs4). Still finished the task. Didn't notice any problems at high context.&lt;p&gt;- When things didn't work first try, it created a &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; file to test, did all the mocking / testing there, and then once it worked edited the main module file. Nice. GPT5-mini would often times edit working files, and then get confused and fail the task.&lt;p&gt;All in all, not bad. At the price point it's at, I could see it as a daily driver. Even agentic stuff w/ opus + gpt5 high as planners and this thing as an implementer. It's fast enough that it might be worth setting it up in parallel and basically replicate pass@x from research.&lt;p&gt;IMO it's good to have options at every level. Having many providers fight for the market is good, it keeps them on their toes, and brings prices down. GPT5-mini is at 2$/MTok, this is at 1.5$/MTok. This is basically "free", in the great scheme of things. I ndon't get the negativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great piece of advice an informal mentor gave me long ago is that &lt;i&gt;there is no information in a rejection&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;That is to say that you cannot draw any conclusions about yourself or your interviewing technique or your skills or anything from the single &lt;i&gt;accept==0&lt;/i&gt; bit that you typically get back.  There are so many reasons that a candidate might get rejected that have nothing to do with one's individual performance in the interview or application process.&lt;p&gt;Having been on the hiring side of the interview table now many more times than on the seeking side, I can say that this is totally true.&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misconceptions I see from job seekers, especially younger ones, is to equate a job interview to a test at school, assuming that there is some objective bar and if you pass it then you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be hired.  It's simply not true.  Frequently more than one good applicant applies for a single open role, and the hiring team has to choose among them.   In that case, you could "pass" and still not get the job and the only reason is that the hiring team liked someone else better.&lt;p&gt;I can only think of one instance where we had two great candidates for one role and management found a way to open another role so we could hire both.  In a few other cases, we had people whom we liked but didn't choose and we forwarded their resumes to other teams who had open roles we thought would fit, but most of the time it's just, "sorry."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO Apple should provide the user with audit logs of which photos/videos were accessed by each app. It might be a long list but it alleviates doubt and would put huge pressure on reputable developers to ensure they don’t get caught doing things the user wouldn’t have expected (even if the user technically allowed it).&lt;/p&gt;

What should I use?"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s).&lt;p&gt;- First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship.&lt;p&gt;- Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer.&lt;p&gt;Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups.&lt;p&gt;Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator (&lt;a href="https://github.com/OperatorFoundation" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/OperatorFoundation&lt;/a&gt;). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case.&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols.&lt;p&gt;- The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term.&lt;p&gt;I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was called the TLM role at google. Technical Lead/Manager. You were expected to code and manage a couple of more junior engineers.&lt;p&gt;It’s part of an effort to have dedicated managers and dedicated engineers instead of hybrid roles.&lt;p&gt;This is being sold as an efficiency win for the sake of the stock price but it’s really just moved a few people around with the TLMs now 100% focused on programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Github website is slow everywhere. It is truly a piece of shit software both in terms of performance but also UX/UI and everything in between.&lt;p&gt;It's a product of many cooks and their brilliant ideas and KPIs, a social network for devs and code being the most "brilliant" of them all. For day to day dev operations is something so mediocre even Gitlab looks like the golden standard compared to Github.&lt;p&gt;And no, the problem is not "Rails" or [ insert any other tech BS to deflect the real problems ].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have looked suicide in the eyes before. And reading the case file for this is absolutely horrific. He wanted help.

It is the clawing feeling of knowing that you want to live, despite feeling like you want to die.&lt;p&gt;We are living in such a horrific moment. We need these things to be legislated. Punished. We need to stop treating them as magic. They had the tools to prevent this. They had the tools to stop the conversation. To steer the user into helpful avenues.&lt;p&gt;When I was suicidal, I googled methods. And I got the number of a local hotline. And I rang it. And a kind man talked me down. And it potentially saved my life. And I am happier, now. I live a worthwhile life, now.&lt;p&gt;But at my lowest.. An AI Model designed to match my tone and be sycophantic to my every whim.

&lt;p&gt;If I may add my view as a formerly high-achieving semiconductor worker that Intel would benefit greatly from having right now, a lot of us pivoted to software and machine learning to earn more money.  My first 2 years as a software engineer earned me more RSUs than a decade in semiconductors.  Semiconductors is not prestigious work in the U.S., despite the strategic importance.  By contrast, it is highly respected and relatively well remunerated in the countries doing well in it.&lt;p&gt;From this lens, the silver lining of the software layoffs going on may be to stem the bleeding of semiconductor workers to the field.  If Intel were really smart, they’d be hiring more right now the people they couldn’t get or retain 3-5 years ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ll be honest: there is a very good chance this won’t work .... At the same time, the China concerns are real, Intel Foundry needs a guarantee of existence to even court customers, and there really is no coming back from an exit. There won’t be a startup to fill Intel’s place. The U.S. will be completely dependent on foreign companies for the most important products on earth, and while everything may seem fine for the next five, ten, or even fifteen years, the seeds of that failure will eventually sprout, just like those 2007 seeds sprouted for Intel over the last couple of years. The only difference is that the repercussions of this failure will be catastrophic not for the U.S.’s leading semiconductor company, but for the U.S. itself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very well argued. It's such a stunning dereliction the US let things get to this point. We were doing the "pivot to Asia" over a decade ago but no one thought to find TSMC on a map and ask whether Intel was driving itself into the dirt? "For want of a nail the kingdom was lost" but in this case the nail is like your entire metallurgical industry outsourced to the territory you plan on fighting over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning to use your device you need to have a contractual relationship with a foreign (unless you are in the US) third party that decides what you can or cannot do with it. Plus using GrapheneOS is less of an option every day, since banks and other "regulated" sectors use Google Play Protect and similar DRMs to prevent you from connecting from whatever device you want. Client-side "trust" means the provider owning the device, not the user.&lt;p&gt;Android shouldn't be considered Open Source anymore, since source code is published in batches and only part of the system is open, with more and more apps going behind the Google ecosystem itself.&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time for a third large phone OS, whether it comes from China getting fed up with the US and Google's shenanigans (Huawei has HarmonyOS but it's not open) or some "GNU/Linux" touch version that has a serious ecosystem. Especially when more and more apps and services are "mobile-first" or "mobile-only" like banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a thing then the solution they offer is incorrect. A big giant red screen: “warning the identity of this application developer has not been verified and this could be an application stealing your data, etc” would have worked.&lt;p&gt;What they want is to get rid of apps like YouTube Vanced that are making them lose money (and other Play Store apps)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely unacceptable. That's like you having to submit your personal details to Microsoft in order to just run a program on Windows. Absolutely nuts and it will not go as they think it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the worst thing to happen to technology in recent times since there is only two major phone OS's.&lt;p&gt;It isn't possible to ban encryption, so the governments have to chip away at security and privacy using these techniques.&lt;p&gt;From: &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://developer.android.com/developer-verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You may also need to upload official government ID."&lt;p&gt;This won't end well for Google or the governments involved when the people get so angry that they are forced to roll this back. Switch to an alternative phone OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people missing the irony here, the term “metaverse,” that Meta is named after, was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 book “Snow Crash.”&lt;p&gt;In the book, the metaverse is a VR version of the internet with an emphasis on accurate sword fights and realistic facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official announcement: &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://developer.android.com/developer-verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16471116" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answ...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally...we all know the Play Store is chock full of malicious garbage, so the verification requirements there don't do jack to protect users. The way I see it, this is nothing but a power grab, a way for Google to kill apps like Revanced for good. They'll just find some bullshit reason to suspend your developer account if you do something they don't like.&lt;p&gt;Every time I hear mentions of "safety" from the folks at Google, I'm reminded that there's a hidden Internet permission on Android that can neuter 95% of malicious apps. But it's hidden, apparently because keeping users from using it to block ads on apps is of greater concern to Google than keeping people safe.&lt;p&gt;&gt; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from&lt;p&gt;This is such an odd statement. I mean, surely they have to be willing to review the contents of apps at &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; point (if only to suspend the accounts of developers who are actually producing malware), or else this whole affair does nothing but introduce friction.&lt;p&gt;TFA had me believing that bypassing the restriction might've been possible by disabling Play Protect, but that doesn't seem to be the case since there aren't any mentions of it in the official info we've been given.&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, that's one less platform I care about supporting with my projects. We're down to just Linux and Windows if you're not willing to sell your soul (no, I will not be making a Google account) just for the right to develop for a certain platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Balking at the $50+ charge for turnkey assembly, I opted to take the financially responsible route and pay $200+ for a hot-air rework station to solder it myself."&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I feel this :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely do not understand where how the idea of building a total surveillance police state, where all speech is monitored, can even as much as seriously be considered by an allegedly pro-democracy, pro-human rights government, much less make it into law.&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Build mass surveillance to prevent the 'bad guys' from coming into political power (its ok, we're the good guys).&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Your political opponents capitalize on your genuinely horrific overreach, and legitimize themselves in the eyes of the public as fighting against tyranny (unfortunately for you they do have a point). They promise to dismantle the system if coming to power.&lt;p&gt;Step 3: They get elected.&lt;p&gt;Step 4: They don't dismantle the system, now the people you planned to use the system against are using it against you.&lt;p&gt;Sounds brilliant, lets do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a a new kind of job for software engineers, sort of like a cross between working with legacy code and toxic site cleanup.&lt;p&gt;Like back in the day being brought in to “just fix” a amalgam of FoxPro-, Excel-, and Access-based ERP that “mostly works” and only “occasionally corrupts all our data” that ambitious sales people put together over last 5 years.&lt;p&gt;But worse - because “ambitious sales people” will no longer be constrained by sandboxes of Excel or Access - they will ship multi-cloud edge-deployed kubernetes micro-services wired with Kafka, and it will be harder to find someone to talk to understand what they were trying to do at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1, pass law.&lt;p&gt;Step 2, demand compliance.&lt;p&gt;Step 3, upon not hearing of compliance, levy fines.&lt;p&gt;Step 4, upon non payment of fines, declare in breach of (2).&lt;p&gt;Step 5, block site from UK using DNS, in the same manner as torrent sites etc.&lt;p&gt;5 was always the goal, 2 to 4 are largely just performative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; At the end of it, they were sketching a completely different architecture without my "PMing". Because they finally understood who was actually using our product.&lt;p&gt;I cannot help but read this whole experience as: “We forced an engineer to take sales calls and we found out that the issue was that our PMs are doing a terrible job communicating between customer and engineering, and our DevOps engineer is more capable/actionable at turning customer needs into working solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
