&lt;p&gt;One of the most insidious parts of this malware's payload, which isn't getting enough attention, is how it chooses the replacement wallet address. It doesn't just pick one at random from its list.&lt;p&gt;It actually calculates the Levenshtein distance between the legitimate address and every address in its own list. It then selects the attacker's address that is visually most similar to the original one.&lt;p&gt;This is a brilliant piece of social engineering baked right into the code. It's designed to specifically defeat the common security habit of only checking the first and last few characters of an address before confirming a transaction.&lt;p&gt;We did a full deobfuscation of the payload and analyzed this specific function. Wrote up the details here for anyone interested: &lt;a href="https://jdstaerk.substack.com/p/we-just-found-malicious-code-in-the" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://jdstaerk.substack.com/p/we-just-found-malicious-code...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

The others remain compromised (8 Sep 17:50 CEST).&lt;p&gt;NPM has yet to get back to me. My NPM account is entirely unreachable; forgot password system does not work. I have no recourse right now but to wait.&lt;p&gt;Email came from support at npmjs dot help.&lt;p&gt;Looked legitimate at first glance. Not making excuses, just had a long week and a panicky morning and was just trying to knock something off my list of to-dos. Made the mistake of clicking the link instead of going directly to the site like I normally would (since I was mobile).&lt;p&gt;Just NPM is affected. Updates to be posted to the `/debug-js` link above.&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was absolutely not just social media ban, it was mostly youth protesting against the corrupt government and unfairness, social media ban was one element that was against the freedom of speech, but it was right around the time where everyone was documenting the rich politicians, their business connections and their families that have been living lavishly and just inheriting the election seats from generation to generation and spinning beurocracy to their sides.&lt;p&gt;I was there a few hours ago. It was a class struggle, but it was bound to be spun up as "kids don't get facebook and throw tantrum".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lid angle sensor is also serialized to the motherboard: you cannot replace it, or the motherboard, without performing calibration, which can be performed by an apple authorized service provider, or alternatively, in Europe (and elsewhere where Apple offers parts for self-service repair), you can purchase the sensor from Apple, connect the machine to the internet after replacing it, to then perform the calibration, only if the sensor was purchased from Apple.&lt;p&gt;So the hardware &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; capable of performing the calibration, Apple just does not graciously grant you the right to install a recycled or third party sensor in &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; machine.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/759262/Torn+Lid+angle+sensor" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/759262/Torn+Lid+angle+se...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Karrenberg, co-author of RFC1918, said this 2017-10-06 on the NANOG mailing list:&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &gt; On 05/10/2017 07:40, Jay R. Ashworth wrote:

  &gt; &gt;
  &gt; &gt; were the ranges chosen to enshrine in the RFC? ...
  &gt; 
  &gt; The RFC explains the reason why we chose three ranges from "Class A,B &amp;
  &gt; C" respectively: CIDR had been specified but had not been widely
  &gt; implemented. There was a significant amount of equipment out there that
  &gt; still was "classful".
  &gt; 
  &gt; As far as I recall the choice of the particular ranges were as follows:
  &gt; 
  &gt; 10/8: the ARPANET had just been turned off. One of us suggested it and
  &gt; Jon considered this a good re-use of this "historical" address block. We
  &gt; also suspected that "net 10" might have been hard coded in some places,
  &gt; so re-using it for private address space rather than in inter-AS routing
  &gt; might have the slight advantage of keeping such silliness local.
  &gt; 
  &gt; 172.16/12: the lowest unallocated /12 in class B space.
  &gt; 
  &gt; 192.168/16: the lowest unallocated /16 in class C block 192/8.
  &gt; 
  &gt; In summary: IANA allocated this space just as it would have for any
  &gt; other purpose. As the IANA, Jon was very consistent unless there was a
  &gt; really good reason to be creative.

&lt;p&gt;When founders put 996 in their job descriptions or Tweet about their 996 culture it’s a helpful signal to avoid that company.&lt;p&gt;The only time I’d actually consider crazy schedules was if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was the founder with a huge equity stake and a once in a lifetime opportunity that would benefit from a short period of 996.&lt;p&gt;For average employees? Absolutely not. If someone wants extraordinary hours they need to be providing extraordinary compensation. Pay me a couple million per year and I’ll do it for a while (though not appropriate for everyone). Pay me the same as the other job opportunities? Absolutely no way I’m going to 996.&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the 996 teams aren’t actually cranking out more work. They’re just working odd hours, doing a little work on the weekends to say they worked the weekend, and they spend a lot of time relaxing at the office because they’re always there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think it is the first half. You’ll realize later on that really you need a totally different structure to write the book. You’ll try to refactor the whole thing, but some obstinate subset of the original readers will insist on using the original index. In the interest of backwards compatibility, you’ll jam the new structure into the margins (so they can keep their precious index).&lt;p&gt;It’s text-debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to use SQLite as an application file format, you should:&lt;p&gt;1. Enable the secure_delete pragma &lt;&lt;a href="https://antonz.org/sqlite-secure-delete/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://antonz.org/sqlite-secure-delete/&lt;/a&gt;&gt; so that when your user deletes something, the data is actually erased.  Otherwise, when a user shares one of your application's files with someone else, the recipient could recover information that the sender thought they had deleted.&lt;p&gt;2. Enable the options described at &lt;&lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/security.html#untrusted_sqlite_database_files" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.sqlite.org/security.html#untrusted_sqlite_databa...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; under "Untrusted SQLite Database Files" to make it safer to open files from untrusted sources.  No one wants to get pwned when they open an email attachment.&lt;p&gt;3. Be aware that when it comes to handling security vulnerabilities, the SQLite developers consider this use case to be niche ("few real-world applications" open SQLite database files from untrusted sources, they say) and they seem to get annoyed that people run fuzzers against SQLite, even though application file formats should definitely be fuzzed. &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fail to mention any of this on their marketing pages about how you should use SQLite as an application file format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; a shared ledger implemented with traditional databases / protocols would be faster, easier, and more transparent.&lt;p&gt;Stablecoin is not a technology. It's an excuse. An excuse to do what banks do while not being regulated like a bank or using the infrastructure banks use. Similar to how Airbnb is not a technology but an excuse to do what hotels do without hotel's license.&lt;p&gt;So it makes no sense to compare it to database, a technology.&lt;p&gt;Will this excuse work? Banking is a heavily regulated field so it's less likely than Airbnb, but it's ultimately up to lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds great, but every time I see this argument, I end up going down the rabbit hole of actually studying how stablecoins operate. And every time, I come to the same conclusion: they &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; rely on trust in an off-chain oracle or custodian. At that point, a shared ledger implemented with traditional databases / protocols would be faster, easier, and more transparent.&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin (and possibly a few others) is one of the few uses of blockchain that actually makes sense. The blockchain serves the currency, and the currency serves the blockchain. The blockchain exists to provide consensus without needing to trust any off-chain entity, but the blockchain relies on computing infrastructure that has real-world costs. The scarcity of Bitcoin (the currency) and arguably-fictitious reward for participation in mining is the incentive for people in the real world to contribute resources required for the blockchain to function.&lt;p&gt;Any real-world value given to Bitcoin is secondary and &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; a result of the fact that (1) mining infrastructure has a cost, and (2) people who understand the system have realized that, unlike fiat, stablecoins, or 1000 other crypto products, Bitcoin has no reliance on trusted, off-chain entities who could manipulate it.&lt;p&gt;You trust your stablecoin's issuer that they hold enough fiat in reserve to match the coin? You might as well trust your bank, but while you're at it, remind them that they don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to take days to process a transaction - they &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; process transactions as fast as (actually &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; than) a blockchain. But I imagine most banks would point to regulation as a reason for the delays, and they might be right.&lt;p&gt;So what are stablecoins really trying to do? Circumvent regulation? Implement something the banks just aren't willing to do themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of crypto skeptics on HN (and we ourselves were disappointed with crypto's payments utility for much of the past decade), so it might be interesting to share what changed our mind over the past couple of years: we started to notice a lot of real-world businesses finding utility in stablecoins. For example, Bridge (a stablecoin orchestration platform that Stripe acquired) is used by SpaceX for managing money in long-tail markets. Another big customer, DolarApp, is providing banking services to customers in Latin America. We're currently adding stablecoin functionality to the Stripe dashboard, and the first user is an Argentinian bike importer that finds transacting with their suppliers to be challenging.&lt;p&gt;Importantly, none of these businesses are using crypto because &lt;i&gt;it's crypto&lt;/i&gt; or for any speculative benefit. They're performing real-world financial activity, and they've found that crypto (via stablecoins) is easier/faster/better than the status quo ante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been this trend recently of calling Wikipedia the last good thing on the internet.&lt;p&gt;And i agree its great, i spend an inordinate amount of my time on Wikimedia related things.&lt;p&gt;But i think there is a danger here with all these articles putting Wikipedia too much on a pedestal. It isn't perfect. It isn't perfectly neutral or perfectly reliable. It has flaws.&lt;p&gt;The true best part of Wikipedia is that its a work in progress and people are working to make it a little better everyday. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact we aren't there yet. We'll never be "there". But hopefully we'll continue to be a little bit closer every day. And that is what makes Wikipedia great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 drop for SWE is easy for me to explain, and it's not on these analysts' list of factors (though I'm not an economic quant, I don't know how you could really control for it): In 2017, a tax bill was passed that cut a particular tax incentive in 2022 in an effort to be counted as "revenue neutral" despite being otherwise a massive tax cut overall. The incentive in question was a writeoff for "Research and development". This means that in 2022, it got effectively much more expensive to hire anyone who falls under that category, including developers not directly necessary for the day-to-day function of a business (hell, one might argue they would have counted anyway) and scientists of most kinds. That this hit big firms, which have a higher relative amount of R&amp;D efforts going at a given time, first makes a lot of sense.&lt;p&gt;For customer service, my explanation is that companies literally do not care about customer service. Automated phone trees, outsourced call centers whose reps have no real power to help a customer, and poorly-made websites have been frustrating people for decades, but businesses never seem to try to compete on doing better at it. It's a cheap win with investors who want to hear about AI initiatives to lay off yet even more of this department, because it doesn't matter if the quality of service declines, there are no market or regulatory forces that are punishing this well enough to ever expect firms to stop breaking it, let alone fix it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;These claims wouldn't matter if the topic weren't so deadly serious. Tech leaders everywhere are buying into the FOMO, convinced their competitors are getting massive gains they're missing out on. This drives them to rebrand as AI-First companies, justify layoffs with newfound productivity narratives, and lowball developer salaries under the assumption that AI has fundamentally changed the value equation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my biggest problem right now. The types of problems I'm trying to solve at work require careful planning and execution, and AI has not been helpful for it in the slightest. My manager told me that the time to deliver my latest project was cut to 20% of the original estimate because we are "an AI-first company". The mass hysteria among SVPs and PMs is absolutely insane right now, I've never seen anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdote here, but when I was in grad school, I was talking to a PhD student i respected a lot. Whenever he read a paper, he would try to write the code out and get it working. I would take a couple of months but he could whip it up in a few days. He explained to me that it was just practice and the more you practice the better you become. He not only coded things quickly, he started analyzing papers quicker too and became really good at synthesizing ideas, knowing what worked and didn't, and built up a phenomenal intuition.&lt;p&gt;These days, I'm fairly senior and don't touch code much anymore but I find it really really instructive to get my hands dirty and struggle through new code and ideas.

&lt;p&gt;Utilization is not a lie, it is a measurement of a well-defined quantity, but people make assumptions to extrapolate capacity models from it, and that is where reality diverges from expectations.&lt;p&gt;Hyperthreading (SMT) and Turbo (clock scaling) are only a part of the variables causing non-linearity, there are a number of other resources that are shared across cores and "run out" as load increases, like memory bandwidth, interconnect capacity, processor caches. Some bottlenecks might come even from the software, like spinlocks, which have non-linear impact on utilization.&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, most CPU utilization metrics average over very long windows, from several seconds to a minute, but what really matters for the performance of a latency-sensitive server happens in the time-scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, and a multi-second average will not distinguish a bursty behavior from a smooth one. The latter has likely much more capacity to scale up.&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the suggested approach is not that accurate either, because it hinges on two inherently unstable concepts&lt;p&gt;&gt; Benchmark how much work your server can do before having errors or unacceptable latency.&lt;p&gt;The measurement of this is extremely noisy, as you want to detect the point where the server starts becoming unstable. Even if you look at a very simple queueing theory model, the derivatives close to saturation explode, so any nondeterministic noise is extremely amplified.&lt;p&gt;&gt; Report how much work your server is currently doing.&lt;p&gt;There is rarely a stable definition of "work". Is it RPS? Request cost can vary even throughout the day. Is it instructions? Same, the typical IPC can vary.&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the confidence intervals you get from the load testing approach might be as large as what you can get from building an empirical model from utilization measurement, as long as you measure your utilization correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, a pet peeve of mine right now is that reporters covering court cases (and we have so many of public interest lately) never seem to simply paste the link to the online PDF decision/ruling for us all to read, right in the story.  (and another user here kindly did that for us below: &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223...&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;p&gt;It seems such a simple step (they must have been using the ruling PDF to write the story) yet why is it always such a hassle for them to feel that they should link the original content?  I would rather be able to see the probably dozens of pages ruling with the full details rather than hear it secondhand from a reporter at this point.  It feels like they want to be the gatekeepers of information, and poor ones at that.&lt;p&gt;I think it should be adopted as standard journalistic practice in fact -- reporting on court rulings must come with the PDF.&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, it will be interesting to see on what grounds the judge decided that this particular data sharing remedy was the solution. Can anyone now simply claim they're a competitor and get access to Google's tons of data?&lt;p&gt;I am not too familiar with antitrust precedent, but to what extent does the judge rule on how specific the data sharing need to be (what types of data, for what time span, how anonymized, etc. etc.) or appoint a special master?   Why is that up to the judge versus the FTC or whoever to propose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an astonishing victory for Google, they must be very happy about it.&lt;p&gt;They get basically everything they want (keeping it all in the tent), plus a negotiating position on search deals where they can refuse something because they can't do it now.&lt;p&gt;Quite why the judge is so concerned about the rise of AI factoring in here is beyond me. It's fundamentally an anticompetitive decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that American media/discourse paints a very distorted view of what life under authoritarian rule is like. The truth is in many countries, unless you’re some kind of minority, politically active, or in legal trouble, day-to-day life is mostly similar to life in the west. But people don’t want to hear that, because we want to feel &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than them. Like we wouldn’t tolerate that kind of life.&lt;p&gt;Of course the most frustrating part about that is as the US and other western countries start sliding into authoritarianism, people deny it because they don’t &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; like it’s authoritarian.&lt;p&gt;Edit: To clarify, I don’t think life is exactly the same - just that the consequences of authoritarianism are much more insidious than they’re portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts. For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.&lt;p&gt;- Exodus 7:1-12 (NIV)&lt;p&gt;Many moons ago I had a girlfriend who worked on an nationally broadcast afternoon show where they often had guest chefs demonstrating dishes, so I would come home from my thankless PhD work to eat Michelin-starred food from a lunchbox. Overall not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compute moat is getting absolutely insane. We're basically at the point where you need a small country's GDP just to stay in the game for one more generation of models.&lt;p&gt;What gets me is that this isn't even a software moat anymore - it's literally just whoever can get their hands on enough GPUs and power infrastructure. TSMC and the power companies are the real kingmakers here. You can have all the talent in the world but if you can't get 100k H100s and a dedicated power plant, you're out.&lt;p&gt;Wonder how much of this $13B is just prepaying for compute vs actual opex. If it's mostly compute, we're watching something weird happen - like the privatization of Manhattan Project-scale infrastructure. Except instead of enriching uranium we're computing gradient descents lol&lt;p&gt;The wildest part is we might look back at this as cheap. GPT-4 training was what, $100M? GPT-5/Opus-4 class probably $1B+? At this rate GPT-7 will need its own sovereign wealth fund&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as "the best engineers." Some engineers are definitely better than others, but once you pass the bar of "really smart, great work ethic," the tech tree diverges pretty dramatically.&lt;p&gt;Some engineers (like Notch) are amazing at quickly putting out vast quantities of mediocre code, prototyping ideas, maintaining a clear product vision, and bringing something into reality quickly. Other engineers (like John Carmack) are great at generating well-founded opinions and finding clever solutions to difficult issues. Some engineers (like Bill Atkinson) worked mostly remotely and developed amazing technology, while other engineers (like Joel Spolsky) insisted on in-office and built a best-in-class mentorship organization.&lt;p&gt;While hiring people with exceptional talent is a step-change when it comes to any organization's ability to accomplish its goals, there is no one metric for "best." Much better to identify the specific skills for which you need exceptional talent, and to create a hiring funnel that identifies people who excel in that dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I 100% agree. I've ran into the same issues, and I would never use Next.js for anything, and I will encourage every team at work to use something else.&lt;p&gt;In general Next.js has so many layers of abstraction that 99.9999% of projects don't need. And the ones that do are probably better off building a bespoke solution from lower level parts.&lt;p&gt;Next.js is easily the worst technology I've ever used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the conversation needs to change from "can't run software of our choice" to "can't participate in society without an apple or google account". I have been living with a de-googled android phone for a number of years, and it is getting harder and harder, while at the same time operating without certain "apps" is becoming more difficult.&lt;p&gt;For example, by bank (abn amro) still allows online banking on desktop via a physical auth device, but they are actively pushing for login only via their app. I called their support line for a lost card, and had to go through to second level support because I didn't have the app. If they get their way, eventually an apple or google account will be mandatory to have a bank account with them.&lt;p&gt;My kid goes to a school that outsourced all communication via an app. They have a web version, but it's barely usable. The app doesn't run without certain google libs installed. Again, to participate in school communication about my kid effectively requires an apple or google account.&lt;p&gt;I feel like the conversation we should be having is that we are sleepwalking into a world where to participate in society you must have an account with either apple or google. If you decide you don't want a relationship with either of those companies you will be extremely disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; In this context this would mean having the ability and documentation to build or install alternative operating systems on this hardware&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work. Everything from banks to Netflix and others are slowly edging out anything where they can't fully verify the chain of control to an entity they can have a legal or contractual relationship with. To be clear, this is fundamental, not incidental. You can't run your own operating system because it's not in Netflix's financial interest for you to do so. Or your banks, or your government. They all benefit from you not having control, so you can't.&lt;p&gt;This is why it's so important to defend the real principles here not just the technical artefacts of them. Netflix shouldn't be able to insist on a particular type of DRM for me to receive their service. Governments shouldn't be able to prevent me from end to end encrypting things. I should be able to opt into all this if I want more security, but it can't be mandatory. However all of these things are not technical, they are principles and rights that we have to argue for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"sideloading" connotates something that is negative.&lt;p&gt;On systems before apple's locked-down iphone, it was just called "installing".&lt;p&gt;The PC revolution started with people just inserting their software into the comptuer and running it.  You didn't have to ask the computer manufacturer or the OS vendor permission to do it.&lt;p&gt;And note that apple doesn't allow you to protect yourself.  You cannot install a firewall and block arbitrary software on your phone.  For example, you can not block apple telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
