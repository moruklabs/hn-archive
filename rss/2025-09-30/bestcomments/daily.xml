&lt;p&gt;&gt; F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to work for the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the app’s distributors.&lt;p&gt;F-Droid's curation saved me at least once when I wanted to upgrade my Simple™ apps and couldn't find them in F-Droid anymore, which led me to learn that SimpleMobileTools was sold to a company that closed sourced the apps[1] and that there's a free fork called Fossify[2].&lt;p&gt;Had I installed these through Google Play, they wouldn't have cared about this particular change and I would've gotten whatever random upgrades the new owners pushed.&lt;p&gt;Each app store's policies have their pros and cons, but that's why it's so important to have a diversity of marketplaces.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issues/241" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://github.com/FossifyOrg" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/FossifyOrg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Federal funding typically covers 80% of bus purchases, with agencies responsible for the remainder."&lt;p&gt;Well, there is your answer. The one making the purchase isn't the one primarily paying for the purchase. This makes them less sensitive to pricing.&lt;p&gt;Kinda like how expensive healthcare is since it is paid for by insurance.&lt;p&gt;Or how you don't care how much you put on your plate or what you choose to eat at an all you can eat buffet.&lt;p&gt;The second you detach the consumer from the price of something, even through an intermediary such as health insurance, that is when they stop caring about how much something costs, and so the price jumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secure, optional digital ID could be useful. But not in today’s UK. Why? Because the state has already shown it can’t be trusted with our data.&lt;p&gt;- Snoopers’ Charter (Investigatory Powers Act 2016): ISPs must keep a year’s worth of records of which websites you visit. More than 40 agencies—from MI5 to the Welsh Ambulance Service—can request it. MI5 has already broken the rules and kept data it shouldn’t have.&lt;p&gt;- Encryption backdoors: Ministers can issue “Technical Capability Notices” to force tech firms to weaken or bypass end-to-end encryption.&lt;p&gt;- Online Safety Act: Expands content-scanning powers that experts warn could undermine privacy for everyone.&lt;p&gt;- Palantir deals: The government has given £1.5 billion+ in contracts to a US surveillance firm that builds predictive-policing tools and runs the NHS’s new Federated Data Platform. Many of those deals are secret.&lt;p&gt;- Wall-to-wall cameras: Millions of CCTV cameras already make the UK one of the most surveilled countries in the world.&lt;p&gt;A universal digital ID would plug straight into this ecosystem, creating an always-on, uniquely identified record of where you go and what you do. Even if paper or card options exist on paper, smartphone-based systems will dominate in practice, leaving those without phones excluded or coerced.&lt;p&gt;I’m not against digital identity in principle. But until the UK government proves it can protect basic privacy—by rolling back mass data retention, ending encryption backdoor demands, and enforcing genuine oversight—any national digital ID is a surveillance power-grab waiting to happen.&lt;p&gt;I'm certain it's worked well in other countries, but I have zero trust in the UK government to handle this responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it's become commonplace in the last 20 years, I'm still shocked to see how companies can pretty much ignore the law, do whatever they want, and have everyone involved shielded from any kind of significant consequences.&lt;p&gt;In situations like this, I think the person at the top of the chain that told employees to perform the illegal installations should be arrested and charged.  On top of that, the company should be fined into bankruptcy.  If the directors knew about it any companies they're involved with shouldn't be allowed to conduct future business in the municipality (or state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pulse today is just a mediocre rehash of prior conversations I’ve had on the platform.&lt;p&gt;I tried to ask GPT-5 pro the other day to just pick an ambitious project it wanted to work on, and I’d carry out whatever physical world tasks it needed me to, and all it did was just come up with project plans which were rehashes of my prior projects framed as its own.&lt;p&gt;I’m rapidly losing interest in all of these tools. It feels like blockchain again in a lot of weird ways. Both will stick around, but fall well short of the tulip mania VCs and tech leaders have pushed.&lt;p&gt;I’ve long contended that tech has lost any soulful vision of the future, it’s just tactical money making all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &gt; Helium is based on Chromium
  &gt; Best privacy by default
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Sorry, pass...&lt;p&gt;Even with un-googled Chromium I do not think these statements are self-consistent. We need browsers that do not allow Google to control the ecosystem. We need legitimate competition. So what, our choices are Firefox (Gecko), Safari (WebKit), and Ladybird?&lt;p&gt;Personally I go with Firefox on most devices and Orion (WebKit) on my iPhone and iPad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &gt; Helium anonymizes all internal requests to the Chrome Web Store via Helium services.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This seems like something pretty easy to mess up. Maybe it is good now, but it sure is going to be a cat and mouse game.&lt;p&gt;I really would be curious to have some breakdown comparison with something like the Mullvad browser (Gecko). I have a lot of trust for both the Mullvad and Tor teams. They have a much longer history working with this kind of stuff and have been consistently updating it since release. Launched in early 2023[0] and last update was last week[1].&lt;p&gt;[0] The Mullvad Browser (mullvad.net) &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35421034"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35421034&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0.5] Mullvad Browser (torproject.org) &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvad-browser" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/mullvad/mullvad-browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do the same thing on the Play Store, for example I just searched for Firefox and the first result is a sponsored spot for Opera. Does Apple do that on the App Store?&lt;p&gt;A funnier example: searching for Amazon gives Temu as the first result. Searching for Temu gives Shein as the first result. Searching for Shein gives Shein as the first result! ...but only because they outbid everyone else for the ad spot on their own name, resulting in Double Shein: &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/0buR8Hq.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/0buR8Hq.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of selecting and highlighting text on computer screens, while reading. I have no issues tracking lines usually, but somehow I still select and highlight. Maybe it is just easier to track lines this way. When I see some web page, that prevents this, then that website gets a -50 reputation score out of 100 in my book. So if the site is perfect in every other way (almost no site is) then -50 still makes it pretty terrible. If additionally it would actually be useful in other ways to highlight and copy text on a site, then I get really annoyed by web non-sense like that. Similarly I get annoyed, if every pixel is some clickable action trigger.&lt;p&gt;This is not what hypertext has been created for. Stop making the web into a cesspit of bad accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great post, thought-provoking. Highly recommended.&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in the past, the US federal government actively made efforts to keep private organizations from becoming too dominant. Here are just a few examples, from memory:&lt;p&gt;* The Bell system was broken up, resulting in a geographically distributed telecom network: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System&lt;/a&gt; : Your phone company was local.&lt;p&gt;* Banks could not cross state lines, resulting in a geographically distributed financial system: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFadden_Act" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFadden_Act&lt;/a&gt; : Your bank was always local.&lt;p&gt;* Banks were prohibited from entering riskier businesses, resulting in a compartmentalized system: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legisla...&lt;/a&gt; : Your bank did not try to sell you investments.&lt;p&gt;* Monopolies and oligopolies were routinely busted, resulting in less concentration in many industries: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law#United_States_antitrust" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law#United_States_...&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;p&gt;The companies you dealt with every day were typically smaller, more local, more subject to competition, and less able to yield economic and political power, particularly at the national level.&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, power and resources seem to be far more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that this page has the following styles which aren't applied anywhere else on the blog:&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   body {
       -webkit-user-select: none;
       -webkit-touch-callout: none;
       -moz-user-select: none;
       -ms-user-select: none;
       user-select: none;
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
I think it's safe to assume that being unable to select text on this page is not unintentional, as several comments here assume, nor "ironic", but an intentional effort to demonstrate how annoying this behavior is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OP, some context from the other side might be helpful.&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are fines for American companies if they do business with Iranians. That's how sanctions work as I'm sure you're aware. But the story doesn't stop there.&lt;p&gt;If an American finds out they are transacting with a sanctioned individual, or citizens of a sanctioned country like Iran or North Korea, the stakes go up: $1M USD fine &lt;i&gt;and up to 20 years in federal prison&lt;/i&gt;. Oh and that's a personal risk -- &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, the manager or executive in charge, and anyone else who is in the know on the transaction is now facing 20 years in federal pounding-in-the-ass prison if they don't immediately cease all communication and break off contact. Hence why they ghost you and remove your data from prod. It sucks, but I would do the same thing in that situation. Nobody should be expected to take that risk.&lt;p&gt;That's why you have these experiences :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazy how he doubled down by just pasting badger's answer into Chat and submitting the (hilariously obvious AI) reply:&lt;p&gt;&gt; Thanks for the quick review. You’re right — my attached PoC does not exercise libcurl and therefore does not demonstrate a cURL bug. I retract the cookie overflow claim and apologize for the noise. Please close this report as invalid. If helpful, I can follow up separately with a minimal C reproducer that actually drives libcurl’s cookie parser (e.g., via an HTTP response with oversized Set-Cookie or using CURLOPT_COOKIELIST) and reference the exact function/line in lib/cookie.c should I find an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't recommend this approach highly enough: have someone with minimal expertise go through your docs with the goal of achieving the goal of the docs. Sit next to them or screenshare. Do not speak to them, certainly do not help, just watch. Watch them fumble. Watch them not know what to do. Watch them experience things you (the author) didn't, because you already had xyz configured on your machine and you forgot users won't have it. (even watch them pretend to know what they're supposed to do when they don't really).&lt;p&gt;If the user achieves what they need with minimal stress/guesswork/ambiguity, the docs pass. If not, note every single place they fail, address each one, and repeat &lt;i&gt;with a new user&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;I've used FAANG docs that don't come close to passing the above criteria.&lt;p&gt;I've been incredibly grateful my org set this high bar. Especially when using docs for critical tech I only use from time to time (where I forget lots of it). Saves meetings, support inquiries, and video calls, because the user can self-serve.&lt;/p&gt;

Why does it mostly make seniors stronger?"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Because juniors don't know when they're being taken down a rabbit hole. So they'll let the LLM go too deep in its hallucinations.&lt;p&gt;I have a Jr that was supposed to deploy a terraform module I built. This task has been hanging out for a while so I went to check in on them. They told me the problem they're having and asked me to take a look.&lt;p&gt;Their repo is a disaster, it's very obvious claude took them down a rabbit hole just from looking. When I asked, "Hey, why is all this python in here? The module has it self contained" and they respond with "I don't know, claude did that" affirming my assumptions.&lt;p&gt;They lack the experience and they're overly reliant on the LLM tools. Not just in the design and implementation phases but also for troubleshooting. And if you're troubleshooting with something that's hallucinating and you don't know enough to know it's hallucinating you're in for a long ride.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the LLM tools have taken away a lot of the type of work I hated doing. I can quickly tell when the LLM is going down a rabbit hole (in most cases at least) and prevent it from continuing. It's kinda re-lit my passion for coding and building software. So that's ended up in me producing more and giving better results.&lt;/p&gt;

Already it’s the best Linux phone in the world, just on that basis.&lt;p&gt;They’re selling it for the same price as the outgoing model despite tons of bullshit tariffs being levied against them. What an achievement!&lt;p&gt;I want a Linux phone that works, and I want to support a world where Linux phones exist and are financially viable to make, therefore I will buy this as my next phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one way to look at it, but ignores the fact that most users use third party community plugins.&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has a truly terrible security model for plugins. As I realized while building my own, Obsidian plugins have full, unrestricted access to all files in the vault.&lt;p&gt;Obsidian could've instead opted to be more 'batteries-included', at the cost of more development effort, but instead leaves this to the community, which in turn increases the attack surface significantly.&lt;p&gt;Or it could have a browser extension like manifest that declares all permissions used by the plugin, where attempting to access a permission that's not granted gets blocked.&lt;p&gt;Both of these approaches would've led to more real security to end users than "we have few third party dependencies".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hollowing out of the middle class in the US isn't because of immigrants, it's because of a sustained campaign by capital to reduce the power of labor over the last 50-odd years and to concentrate wealth as best they can. Immigrant labor contributes to that because we've got inadequate labor protections and because we bought into the idea that lower consumer prices was a fine reason to ignore both labor and antitrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim that Google secretly wants YouTube downloaders to work doesn't hold up. Their focus is on delivering videos across a vast range of devices without breaking playback(and even that is blurring[0]), not enabling downloads.&lt;p&gt;If you dive into the yt-dlp source code, you see the insane complexity of calculations needed to download a video. There is code to handle nsig checks, internal YouTube API quirks, and constant obfuscation that makes it a nightmare(and the maintainers heroes) to keep up.  Google frequently rejects download attempts, blocks certain devices or access methods, and breaks techniques that yt-dlp relies on.&lt;p&gt;Half the battle is working around attempts by Google to make ads unblockable, and the other half is working around their attempts to shut down downloaders. The idea of a "gray market ecosystem" they tacitly approve ignores how aggressively they tweak their systems to make downloading as unreliable as possible. If Google wanted downloaders to thrive, they wouldn't make developers jump through these hoops. Just look at the yt-dlp issue tracker overflowing with reports of broken functionality. There are no secret nods, handshakes, or other winks, as Google begins to care less and less about compatibility, the doors will close. For example, there is already a secret header used for authenticating that you are using the Google version of Chrome browser [1] [2] that will probably be expanded.&lt;p&gt;[0] Ask HN: Does anyone else notice YouTube causing 100% CPU usage and stattering?

&lt;p&gt;The top end of H1B has been great for America.  In the last few decades, there has been growth of abuse of the program to get mid level talent at below market rates which really hurts the middle class in America.  People need to understand that most reformists don't want to get rid of the truly exceptional immigration to the US.  We need to limit the volume, especially the immigrants that are directly competing with a hollowed out middle class in the US.  Let me know if you want further reading on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s plenty of interesting debates to be had about immigration policy and its effects on the labor market, but one thing worth noting here is that the primary problem that damn near every other country on earth has isn’t immigration, it’s brain drain.&lt;p&gt;A core strategic strength of the US over the last century has been that everyone with any talent wants to come here to work, and by and large we’ve let them do so. You can argue how well that’s worked out for us - having worked with a great many extremely talented H1bs in an industry largely built by immigrants, I’d consider it pretty positive - but it damn sure hasn’t worked out well for the countries those talented folks came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't get the hate here. This is practically a public service and Deno doesn't have any direct or obvious material gains from this. Definitely not more then dozens of other projects (from Chrome to Node.js to Tutorial sites and any company offering something with JS)&lt;p&gt;So what if they are a VC backed company? If you perform a public service, it's fair to ask the public for money.
No one is suggesting this money would go to fund their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah no need, corporate IT already make all URLs malicious looking through some microsoft "secure link" service, and constantly shows everyone shady looking prompts that constantly change and have cmd.exe windows flash in at random.&lt;p&gt;A phone call from Microsoft about my Norton anti-virus subscription putting me into debt that can only be settled with Nintendo gift cards bought in cash across 16 specific gas stations seem much more legitimate in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
