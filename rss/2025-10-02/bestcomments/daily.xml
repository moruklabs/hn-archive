&lt;p&gt;Always overlooked point in these pro/anti-spreadsheet discussions:&lt;p&gt;A spreadsheet gives you a DB, a quickly and easily customized UI, and iterative / easy-to-debug data processing all in a package that everyone in the working world already understands. AND with a freedom that allows the creator to do it however they want. AND it's fairly portable.&lt;p&gt;You can build incredible things in spreadsheets. I remain convinced that it's the most creative and powerful piece of software we have available, especially so for people who can't code.&lt;p&gt;With that power and freedom comes downsides, sure; and we can debate the merits of it being online, or whether this or that vendor is preferable; but my deep appreciation for spreadsheets remains undiminished by these mere trifles.&lt;p&gt;It's the best authoring tool we've ever devised.&lt;p&gt;EDIT TO ADD: the only other thing that seems to 'rhyme' with spreadsheets in the same way is: HyperCard. Flexible workbench that let you stitch together applications, data, UX, etc. RIP HyperCard, may you be never forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to this &amp; the Jobs interview - an oil industry proverb: a healthy oil company has a geologist in charge, a mature one has an engineer in charge, a declining one has an accountant in charge, and a dying one has a lawyer in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll be interesting to see if they still &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; design and build a new ground-up airplane design.  The last all-new design was the 787, initiated in 2003 and launched in 2009, and its design was fraught with problems.  Before then was the 777 in the early 90s (pre-McDonnell takeover), and the 757/767 in the early 80s.&lt;p&gt;There's a phenomena that ofter occurs with large organizations where once their markets mature, everybody who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; build a product end-to-end leaves or gets forced out, leaving only people with highly specialized maintenance skillsets.  The former group has no work to do, after all, so why should the company keep them around?  But then if the market ecosystem shifts, and a new product is necessary, they no longer have the capacity to build ground-up new products.  All those people have left, and won't come anywhere near the company.&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs spoke eloquently about this phenomena in an old interview:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1WrHH-WtaA" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1WrHH-WtaA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a pre-existing problem, even if reliance on LLMs is making it worse.&lt;p&gt;Naur (&lt;a href="https://gwern.net/doc/cs/algorithm/1985-naur.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://gwern.net/doc/cs/algorithm/1985-naur.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) called it "theory building":&lt;p&gt;&gt; The death of a program happens when the programmer team possessing its theory is dissolved. A dead program may
continue to be used for execution in a computer and to produce useful results. The actual state of death becomes visible when demands for modifications of the program cannot be intelligently answered. Revival of a program is the rebuilding of its theory by a new programmer team.&lt;p&gt;Lamport calls it "programming ≠ coding", where programming is "what you want to achieve and how" and coding is telling the computer how to do it.&lt;p&gt;I strongly agree with all of this.  Even if your dev team skipped any kind of theory-building or modelling phase, they'd still passively absorb some of the model while typing the code into the computer.  I think that it's this last resort of &lt;i&gt;incidental&lt;/i&gt; model building that the LLM replaces.&lt;p&gt;I suspect that there is a strong correlation between programmers who don't think that there needs to be a model/theory, and those who are reporting that LLMs are speeding them up.&lt;/p&gt;

(September 2025)"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Currently a one-man side project:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://laboratory.love" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://laboratory.love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their "safe" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe.&lt;p&gt;This seemed like a solvable problem.&lt;p&gt;Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about.&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do.&lt;p&gt;The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner.&lt;p&gt;Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public.&lt;p&gt;So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!)&lt;p&gt;You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: &lt;a href="https://laboratory.love" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://laboratory.love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had access to a preview over the weekend, I published some notes here: &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/29/claude-sonnet-4-5/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/29/claude-sonnet-4-5/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very good - I think probably a tiny bit better than GPT-5-Codex, based on vibes more than a comprehensive comparison (there are plenty of benchmarks out there that attempt to be more methodical than vibes).&lt;p&gt;It particularly shines when you try it on &lt;a href="https://claude.ai/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://claude.ai/&lt;/a&gt; using its brand new Python/Node.js code interpreter mode. Try this prompt and see what happens:&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Checkout https://github.com/simonw/llm and run the tests with
  
  pip install -e '.[test]'
  pytest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
I then had it iterate on a pretty complex database refactoring task, described in my post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archivist here. Google is not an archive. Neither is Tumblr or Flickr or any other platform that might delete your content at any time. They're companies and it's their job to make money. This is why my profession exists. We don't make money, which is why we're not well funded, but we have a whole lot of training, technical knowledge, and professional ethics around saving information and making it accessible. If you want to preserve your records, talk to an archivist because you can't assume some faceless corporation will do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it's a generational or cultural difference present in the comments here.&lt;p&gt;I am sympathetic to the author, and I also find video a bit invasive of privacy in a way that photos aren't.&lt;p&gt;I therefore find the (obviously common) attitude that videos are just "something you need to accept" quite alien, but I wonder how much of that attitude is just comments coming from a younger generation that have grown up with the idea that they're recorded all the time.&lt;p&gt;I'm old enough thankfully to have grown up without video being present, that's probably not true for someone 10 years younger than me.&lt;p&gt;There's also a big difference in my mind between, "You might be filmed on occassion" and, "A recording of this goes up on youtube every single week".&lt;p&gt;With the former you can still reasonably anonymous, with the latter you risk becoming a side character in someone elses' parasocial relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to work for the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the app’s distributors.&lt;p&gt;F-Droid's curation saved me at least once when I wanted to upgrade my Simple™ apps and couldn't find them in F-Droid anymore, which led me to learn that SimpleMobileTools was sold to a company that closed sourced the apps[1] and that there's a free fork called Fossify[2].&lt;p&gt;Had I installed these through Google Play, they wouldn't have cared about this particular change and I would've gotten whatever random upgrades the new owners pushed.&lt;p&gt;Each app store's policies have their pros and cons, but that's why it's so important to have a diversity of marketplaces.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issues/241" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://github.com/FossifyOrg" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/FossifyOrg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to see an anti-AI take that doesn't hinge on the idea that technology forces people to be lazy/careless/thoughtless.&lt;p&gt;The plan-build-test-reflect loop is equally important when using an LLM to generate code, as anyone who's seriously used the tech knows: if you yolo your way through a build without thought, it will collapse in on itself quickly. But if you DO apply that loop, you get to spend much more time on the part I personally enjoy, architecting the build and testing the resultant experience.&lt;p&gt;&gt; While the LLMs get to blast through all the fun, easy work at lightning speed, we are then left with all the thankless tasks&lt;p&gt;This is, to me, the root of one disagreement I see playing out in every industry where AI has achieved any level of mastery. There's a divide between people who enjoy the physical experience of the work and people who enjoy the mental experience of the work. If the thinking bit is your favorite part, AI allows you to spend nearly all of your time there if you wish, from concept through troubleshooting. But if you like the doing, the typing, fiddling with knobs and configs, etc etc, all AI does is take the good part away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Microsoft/Google/KDE's order. The author's situation is extremely rare, and the situation where someone wants "10" to be before "9" is far more common. Moreover, desktops don't label this sorting "alphabetical" (E: and it would really be "lexicographic"*), they label it "by name" (an informal criteria), so technically they're not lying.&lt;p&gt;&gt; I miss the time when computers did what you told them to, instead of trying to read your mind.&lt;p&gt;You may be looking at that time through rose-tinted glasses. I don't like when computers &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt; to me either, but "mind-reading" is really helpful in ways we take for granted, like autosave. Desktops can have an option to sort files truly alphabetically, but the more common case should always be the default; that's the definition of "intuitive".&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404022#45405279"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404022#45405279&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Privacy Badger doesn’t block ads unless they happen to be tracking you; in fact, one of our goals is to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an easy solution to this --- it is called "context sensitive" advertising. And the idea is simple --- ads are prioritized based on what you're currently viewing, not your viewing history (aka "personalized ads").&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with "personalized ads"?  They are fundamentally rooted in the past --- and the past is often no longer relevant.  Just because I searched for a car last week doesn't mean I haven't bought one already --- so why am I seeing auto ads when I search for pet supplies?. But if I'm currently looking at an auto dealers web site, the odds are pretty good that I'm still interested in buying one.&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with advertisers? Without any real proof, they have bought into this vision of advertising that is illogical, ineffective and simply not true in many cases --- the idea that personal browsing history is a good indicator of the future.&lt;p&gt;In the process, they have surrendered their ad budgets to a "black box" process that they have no insight into or control over and can be easily manipulated against them.&lt;p&gt;So why do I care?  Because we *all* pay a price for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's great to see Typst getting more visibility. We migrated a real-world workload to it a couple of years back: generating and e-mailing 1.5M+ PDFs daily at my org, Zerodha.&lt;p&gt;Our previous pipeline was LaTeX-based (first pdflatex, then lualatex), but we were constantly fighting cryptic memory errors on large documents and huge Docker image sizes that slowed down boot times of our ephemeral workers.&lt;p&gt;Switching to Typst was a massive win for us. The single static binary resulted in tiny images and faster boot times. More importantly, the performance gains were huge. Overall compile times were ~3–4× faster than LaTeX. On really large documents (2000+ pages, mostly tables), Typst compiles in ~1 minute vs. ~18 minutes with lualatex.&lt;p&gt;Beyond performance, the better developer experience and good error messages was a nice bonus too.&lt;p&gt;We wrote a detailed post about the entire architecture - from the job orchestration with Nomad to the S3 optimizations and the Typst migration in particular.

&lt;p&gt;"Federal funding typically covers 80% of bus purchases, with agencies responsible for the remainder."&lt;p&gt;Well, there is your answer. The one making the purchase isn't the one primarily paying for the purchase. This makes them less sensitive to pricing.&lt;p&gt;Kinda like how expensive healthcare is since it is paid for by insurance.&lt;p&gt;Or how you don't care how much you put on your plate or what you choose to eat at an all you can eat buffet.&lt;p&gt;The second you detach the consumer from the price of something, even through an intermediary such as health insurance, that is when they stop caring about how much something costs, and so the price jumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secure, optional digital ID could be useful. But not in today’s UK. Why? Because the state has already shown it can’t be trusted with our data.&lt;p&gt;- Snoopers’ Charter (Investigatory Powers Act 2016): ISPs must keep a year’s worth of records of which websites you visit. More than 40 agencies—from MI5 to the Welsh Ambulance Service—can request it. MI5 has already broken the rules and kept data it shouldn’t have.&lt;p&gt;- Encryption backdoors: Ministers can issue “Technical Capability Notices” to force tech firms to weaken or bypass end-to-end encryption.&lt;p&gt;- Online Safety Act: Expands content-scanning powers that experts warn could undermine privacy for everyone.&lt;p&gt;- Palantir deals: The government has given £1.5 billion+ in contracts to a US surveillance firm that builds predictive-policing tools and runs the NHS’s new Federated Data Platform. Many of those deals are secret.&lt;p&gt;- Wall-to-wall cameras: Millions of CCTV cameras already make the UK one of the most surveilled countries in the world.&lt;p&gt;A universal digital ID would plug straight into this ecosystem, creating an always-on, uniquely identified record of where you go and what you do. Even if paper or card options exist on paper, smartphone-based systems will dominate in practice, leaving those without phones excluded or coerced.&lt;p&gt;I’m not against digital identity in principle. But until the UK government proves it can protect basic privacy—by rolling back mass data retention, ending encryption backdoor demands, and enforcing genuine oversight—any national digital ID is a surveillance power-grab waiting to happen.&lt;p&gt;I'm certain it's worked well in other countries, but I have zero trust in the UK government to handle this responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it's become commonplace in the last 20 years, I'm still shocked to see how companies can pretty much ignore the law, do whatever they want, and have everyone involved shielded from any kind of significant consequences.&lt;p&gt;In situations like this, I think the person at the top of the chain that told employees to perform the illegal installations should be arrested and charged.  On top of that, the company should be fined into bankruptcy.  If the directors knew about it any companies they're involved with shouldn't be allowed to conduct future business in the municipality (or state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear citizens of the EU:&lt;p&gt;If this gets pushed through, you will gradually lose control of your government much like how the people of the UK already lost control of theirs.&lt;p&gt;What are you going to do when the government's interests inevitably drift out of alignment with yours? Start a political movement? You will have the police knocking on your door for criticizing the establishment.&lt;p&gt;Start a revolution? You have no weapons. You can't even organize a resistance because all channels of communication are monitored.&lt;p&gt;You have neither the pen nor the sword. There is no longer an incentive for the government to serve you, and so it eventually won't.&lt;p&gt;No amount of protest will recover the freedom you once had. You're heading towards a society where everyone feels oppressed but no one can do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pulse today is just a mediocre rehash of prior conversations I’ve had on the platform.&lt;p&gt;I tried to ask GPT-5 pro the other day to just pick an ambitious project it wanted to work on, and I’d carry out whatever physical world tasks it needed me to, and all it did was just come up with project plans which were rehashes of my prior projects framed as its own.&lt;p&gt;I’m rapidly losing interest in all of these tools. It feels like blockchain again in a lot of weird ways. Both will stick around, but fall well short of the tulip mania VCs and tech leaders have pushed.&lt;p&gt;I’ve long contended that tech has lost any soulful vision of the future, it’s just tactical money making all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the challenge for society here is not to simply reject attempts like this, but how to prevent them from being pushed over and over until a specific context allows it to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am seeing several kneejerk "Microsoft bad" reactions here, which HNers don't do for many other companies. I encourage many of you to read what is written.&lt;p&gt;They listened to their internal staff and stakeholders and public pressure, and did terminated the contract instead of ignoring it or doubling down.&lt;p&gt;That is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "old web" to me was GeoCities and Angelfire, it was customizing your NeoPets shop, it was hosting a web server on your home network on port 8080. It was mailing a check to an address you found on a website in hopes that you'd receive a bootleg anime VHS in the mail a few weeks later. It was webrings, banners, and websites reviewing and promoting other sites through a "links" section. It was right-clicking to copy an image and getting a Javascript alert telling you the image was "copyright". It was learning that you could copy it anyway if you spammed enter. It was hotlinking those same images in protest. It was waiting 5 hours to download a 37 second 320x240 RealPlayer video. It was having a password "protected" area where the password is base64 encoded in the source. It was trying the same search query in multiple search engines because they would return different results. It was typing random URLs in to see if you could find something interesting yourself. It was playing midi files on loop in the background. It was Macromedia Flash, explicit popups, pure yellow text on black backgrounds, and reformatting your computer to get rid of viruses.&lt;p&gt;The "old web" was McDonalds in the early 90's. This looks more like McDonalds today, maybe tomorrow it will be a Starbucks.&lt;p&gt;I run my own blog on AWS for ~a dollar a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &gt; Helium is based on Chromium
  &gt; Best privacy by default
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Sorry, pass...&lt;p&gt;Even with un-googled Chromium I do not think these statements are self-consistent. We need browsers that do not allow Google to control the ecosystem. We need legitimate competition. So what, our choices are Firefox (Gecko), Safari (WebKit), and Ladybird?&lt;p&gt;Personally I go with Firefox on most devices and Orion (WebKit) on my iPhone and iPad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &gt; Helium anonymizes all internal requests to the Chrome Web Store via Helium services.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This seems like something pretty easy to mess up. Maybe it is good now, but it sure is going to be a cat and mouse game.&lt;p&gt;I really would be curious to have some breakdown comparison with something like the Mullvad browser (Gecko). I have a lot of trust for both the Mullvad and Tor teams. They have a much longer history working with this kind of stuff and have been consistently updating it since release. Launched in early 2023[0] and last update was last week[1].&lt;p&gt;[0] The Mullvad Browser (mullvad.net) &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35421034"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35421034&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[0.5] Mullvad Browser (torproject.org) &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvad-browser" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/mullvad/mullvad-browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do the same thing on the Play Store, for example I just searched for Firefox and the first result is a sponsored spot for Opera. Does Apple do that on the App Store?&lt;p&gt;A funnier example: searching for Amazon gives Temu as the first result. Searching for Temu gives Shein as the first result. Searching for Shein gives Shein as the first result! ...but only because they outbid everyone else for the ad spot on their own name, resulting in Double Shein: &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/0buR8Hq.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/0buR8Hq.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of selecting and highlighting text on computer screens, while reading. I have no issues tracking lines usually, but somehow I still select and highlight. Maybe it is just easier to track lines this way. When I see some web page, that prevents this, then that website gets a -50 reputation score out of 100 in my book. So if the site is perfect in every other way (almost no site is) then -50 still makes it pretty terrible. If additionally it would actually be useful in other ways to highlight and copy text on a site, then I get really annoyed by web non-sense like that. Similarly I get annoyed, if every pixel is some clickable action trigger.&lt;p&gt;This is not what hypertext has been created for. Stop making the web into a cesspit of bad accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great post, thought-provoking. Highly recommended.&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in the past, the US federal government actively made efforts to keep private organizations from becoming too dominant. Here are just a few examples, from memory:&lt;p&gt;* The Bell system was broken up, resulting in a geographically distributed telecom network: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System&lt;/a&gt; : Your phone company was local.&lt;p&gt;* Banks could not cross state lines, resulting in a geographically distributed financial system: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFadden_Act" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFadden_Act&lt;/a&gt; : Your bank was always local.&lt;p&gt;* Banks were prohibited from entering riskier businesses, resulting in a compartmentalized system: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legisla...&lt;/a&gt; : Your bank did not try to sell you investments.&lt;p&gt;* Monopolies and oligopolies were routinely busted, resulting in less concentration in many industries: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law#United_States_antitrust" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law#United_States_...&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;p&gt;The companies you dealt with every day were typically smaller, more local, more subject to competition, and less able to yield economic and political power, particularly at the national level.&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, power and resources seem to be far more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;
