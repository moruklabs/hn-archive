&lt;p&gt;I fear the conceptual churn we're going to endure in the coming years will rival frontend dev.&lt;p&gt;Across ChatGPT and Claude we now have tools, functions, skills, agents, subagents, commands, and apps, and there's a metastasizing complex of vibe frameworks feeding on this mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's short sighted. A burrito is a perfect candidate for ballistic trajectory. They can easily absorb the high g-force associated with traditional mortar-style launch system, even up to exotic "space gun" capable of intercontinental delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be in the minority here but I've consistently found Gemini to be better than ChatGPT, Claude and Deepseek (I get access to all of the pro models through work)&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's just the kind of work I'm doing, a lot of web development with html/scss, and Google has crawled the internet so they have more data to work with.&lt;p&gt;I reckon different models are better at different kinds of work, but Gemini is pretty excellent at UI/UX web development, in my experience&lt;p&gt;Very excited to see what 3.0 is like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think you need to "justify layoffs". If a company feels an employee is not being productive, they should be allowed to let them go. Same way if an employee feels he is getting underpaid or wants to work somewhere else, they should be allowed to leave.&lt;p&gt;I've actually always liked working for companies in which the objective was straight forward. None of this "we're a family" stuff. You should be kind, and all the places I was at were kind. But layoffs are a reality and reducing headcount at times is part of that. You need a way to get rid of dead wood, otherwise you would be too afraid to grow and hire when you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; "EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."&lt;p&gt;Seems to be a common theme in 2025: Actually-healthy companies cosplaying as struggling companies, as an excuse to justify layoffs and other activities that transfer wealth and power from employees to management and shareholders. Like, does anyone think any of these BigTech (and MediumTech) companies who are all doing layoffs are really "struggling" and "vulnerable"? It's always just an unbelievable excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely why I built &lt;a href="https://freetofile.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://freetofile.com&lt;/a&gt; (it’s a simple static site with React for internationalization that automatically renders in Spanish, Chinese, Haitian Creole, or English depending on browser settings).  It’s shocking and depressing how many low income people don’t know they don’t need to spend $100-200 to file their taxes.&lt;p&gt;I want to blanket my area (well the whole country really but baby steps…) in signs with the URL during tax season.  I really do loathe the entire industry at this point due to their gross practices around free filing.  Some offer “free” online filing but deceptively upsell until they squeeze some money out of the customer.  So I want to make any little push back I can against these companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the US have a tax prep industry in the first place?&lt;p&gt;In every other country in the world, taxes are handled by their respective financial authorities.&lt;p&gt;Why must every service and thing in the US must be a private profit making thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;I would say that specifically with Secure Boot, Microsoft actually promoted user choice: A Windows Logo compliant PC needs to have Microsoft's root of trust installed by default. Microsoft could have stopped there, but they didn't.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not the case with the initial rollout of Secure Boot, it was combined with locked BIOS to lock PCs so that they could only boot Windows 8 on some devices. This was the case on Windows RT ARM machines from that era.&lt;p&gt;All that has to be done today for machines to be locked down again is to flip a bit or blow an e-fuse. It's already the case on phones and tablets.&lt;p&gt;There is also a real potential for abusing TPMs or cryptographic co-processors to enforce remote attestation.&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who agrees with your first paragraph and uses Secure Boot + TPMs on all of my machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the hate that Google (rightly) gets for some of their work in other domains, I appreciate that they continue to put major resources behind using AI to try and save lives in medicine and autonomous driving.&lt;p&gt;Easy to take for granted, but their peer companies are not doing this type of long term investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a IT solutions provider for the public and small business. I think the changes to Windows 11 is gearing up to work with organizations to create a surveillance state.&lt;p&gt;So I have to decided to promote Linux over Windows for computers I build for customers. If you have any suggestions on how I can make this promotion, better let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly annoying to read. So many super short sentences with the “not just X. Also Y” format. Little hooks like “The attack vector?”&lt;p&gt;“Not fancy security tools. Not expensive antivirus software. Just asking my coding assistant…”&lt;p&gt;I actually feel like AI articles are becoming easier to spot. Maybe we’re all just collectively noticing the patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is so interesting, but I can’t shake the feeling it was written by AI. The writing style has that feel for me.&lt;p&gt;Maybe that shouldn’t bother me? Like, maybe the author would never have had time to write this otherwise, and I would never have learned about his experience.&lt;p&gt;But I can't help wishing he'd just written about it himself. Maybe that's unreasonable--I shouldn't expect people to do extra work for free. But if this happened to me, I would &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to write about it myself...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To any Linux users, I recently bought a fully loaded M4 MacBook pro to replace my aging Lenovo and strongly regret it. I thought I would use it for playing with LLMs, but local dev on a Mac is not fun and I still don't have it fully set up. I'll probably replace it with a framework at some point in the near future.&lt;p&gt;Edit: okay, that garnered more attention than I expected, I guess I owe a qualification.&lt;p&gt;1. Everything is just slightly different. I had to split all my dot files into common/Linux/Mac specific sections. Don't expect to be able to clone and build any random C++ project unless someone in the project is specifically targeting Mac.&lt;p&gt;2. Not everything is supported natively on arm64. I had an idea and wanted to spin up a project using DynamoRIO, but wasn't supported. Others have mentioned the docker quirks.&lt;p&gt;3. The window manager. I'm not a fan of all the animations and needing to gester between screens (and yes, I've been down the hotkeys rabbit hole). To install a 3rd party window manager you need to disable some security setting because appearantly they work by injecting into the display manager and calling private APIs.&lt;p&gt;So my person takeaway was that I took the openness of the Linux ecosystem for granted (I've always had a local checkout of the kernel so I can grep an error message if needed). Losing that for me felt like wearing a straightjacket. Ironically I have a MBP at work, but spend my day ssh'd into a Linux box. It's a great machine for running a web browser and terminal emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Tahoe however makes my M1 Air feel sluggish doing the exact same tasks ive been last couple of years.&lt;p&gt;I have a work provided M2 Pro with 32GB of RAM. After the Tahoe upgrade it feels like one of the sluggish PCs at the house. It is the only one that I can see the mouse teleporting sometimes when I move it fast. This is after disabling transparency in Accessibility settings mind you, it was even worse before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M5 MacBook Pro still gets the Broadcom WiFi chip but the M5 iPad Pros get the N1 and C1X (Sweet).&lt;p&gt;All in all, apple is doing some incredible things with hardware.&lt;p&gt;Software teams at apple really need to get their act together. The M1 itself is so powerful that nobody really needs to upgrade that for most things most people do on their computers. Tahoe however makes my M1 Air feel sluggish doing the exact same tasks ive been last couple of years. I really hope this is not intentional from Apple to make me upgrade. That would be a big let down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super interested in the Vision Pro when it was first released. Then I found out they went with an app model and the device could only display a single MacOS window. There went my dream of surrounding myself with a bunch of vim windows and terminals.&lt;p&gt;If they'd focused on maximizing the device's usefulness instead of its revenue stream, maybe things would have worked out better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tried to call this "universal" until people pointed out it is the opposite of universal. This program is a wild distortion of what UBI is meant to be.&lt;p&gt;Everyone who would _like_ to be an artist, but can't afford to be one, is disqualified. Meanwhile, the acquaintance of mine who sold his house in London at a large profit and retired to a cottage in Westmeath to live off his gains and noodle around on the guitar a bit is a recipient of funds from this program.&lt;p&gt;Tellingly there's very little information about how to _become_ an artist with this program.&lt;p&gt;Edit/addendum: Worth noting they've produced some _very_ dubious numbers to claim this program is a net gain economically. &lt;a href="https://www.rte.ie/culture/2025/0923/1534768-basic-income-for-the-arts-pilot-generated-over-100m-in-benefits/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.rte.ie/culture/2025/0923/1534768-basic-income-fo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;"""
A key component of the total benefits came from psychological wellbeing, which contributed almost €80 million. In addition, the report estimates that audience engagement with the arts generated €16.9 million in social value, based on public willingness-to-pay for cultural experiences.
"""&lt;p&gt;And, as much as I like psychological wellbeing (who doesn't!) - saying that it's worth €80 million when you didn't actually get €80 million doesn't help things when it comes time to pay for the program. I'm unsurprised that giving people money improved their psychological well being.&lt;p&gt;I'd be more excited to see basic income for Deliveroo riders and people working in chippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi HN. I run a marketing agency and fell down this rabbit hole after a client's analytics made no sense (50k visitors, 47 sales). I ended up building a simple script to track user behavior and analyzed 200+ small e-commerce sites. The average was 73% bot traffic that standard analytics counts as real.&lt;p&gt;The bots are getting creepily good at mimicking engagement. I wrote up my findings, including some of the bizarre patterns I saw and the off-the-record conversations I had with ad tech insiders. It seems like a massive, open secret that nobody wants to talk about because the whole system is propped up by it.&lt;p&gt;I'm curious if other developers, founders, or marketers here have seen similar discrepancies in their own data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can't they just partner with postmarketOS here?&lt;p&gt;Why do we have to have /e/OS instead of a better supported LineageOS, because /e/ is a 1:1 copy anyways?&lt;p&gt;Why do we have to have a Librephone project now instead of partnering with say, Fairphone and the Pine64 people?&lt;p&gt;Open source loses this war because proprietary devices are streamlined. The only thing that comes close to this is GrapheneOS, LineageOS, and postmarketOS.&lt;p&gt;LineageOS has huge problems since the mandatory eBPF requirements of late Android versions, which postmarketOS and its upstreamed kernel drivers could fix. GrapheneOS has huge problems because of Pixel devices, which LineageOS could help with.&lt;p&gt;We need a unification of this ecosystem because each on their own is hardly surviving on their own against the megacorporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find LLM generated code ends up pushing review/maintenance burden onto others. It "looks" right at first glance, and passes superficial tests, so it's easy to get merged. But then as you build on top of it, you realize the foundations are hastily put together, so a lot of it needs to be rewritten. Fine for throwaway or exploratory work, but heaven help you if you're working in a project where people use LLMs to "fix" bugs generated by previous LLM generated code.&lt;p&gt;So yes it does increase "velocity" for the person A who can get away with using it. But then the decrease in velocity for person B trying to build on top of that code is never properly tracked. It's like a game of hot potato, if you want to game the metrics you better be the one working on greenfield code (although I suppose maintenance work has never been looked at favorably in performance review; but now the cycle of code rot is accelerated)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I don't think the most important challenge is in binary firmware blobs, but the software which people depend upon to run their lives. What does it matter if you can run a completely free software stack on your phone, if your bank software (or your required government ID, as is looking depressingly likely) requires you to run a Big Tech approved phone OS? Perhaps the FSF can't do much about that, but that is where I feel they could truly make the biggest difference for freedom for the average user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“None of the safe programming languages existed for the first 10 years of SQLite's existence. SQLite could be recoded in Go or Rust, but doing so would probably introduce far more bugs than would be fixed, and it may also result in slower code.”&lt;p&gt;Modern languages might do more than C to prevent programmers from writing buggy code, but if you already have bug-free code due to massive time, attention, and testing, and the rate of change is low (or zero), it doesn’t really matter what the language is. SQLIte could be assembly language for all it would matter.&lt;/p&gt;
