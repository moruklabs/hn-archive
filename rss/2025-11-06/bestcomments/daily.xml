&lt;p&gt;The grid is &lt;i&gt;HUGELY&lt;/i&gt; expensive, an absolutely massive cost for our electricity. And it would still be  expensive in a well-regulated environment where you can quickly and easily get permission to build, without, say, voter ballot propositions illegally blocking a transmission line for years [1]. Here in the US we have a very very poorly regulated environment for adding to our grid, it moves slower than molasses and there are so many parties that have unilateral veto points. The advent of a new transmission route in the US these days is pretty much a miracle event.&lt;p&gt;Now imagine a world where there's tons of bribes to government officials all along the way to get a grid going (in the US you just need to bribe landowners and hold-outs). Or there's bribes to get a permit for the large centralized electriticy generator. And you have to deal with importing a whole new skill set and trades, on top of importing all the materials, fuel, etc.&lt;p&gt;Decentralized solar plus batteries is already cheaper than electricity + transmission for me at my home in the US. The only thing stopping me is the permitting hassle or the contractor hassle.&lt;p&gt;Out in greenfield, solar plus storage is so revolutionary. This is bigger than going straight to mobile phones instead of landlines.&lt;p&gt;Africa is going to get so much power, and it's all going to be clean, renewable energy. Thanks to all the entrepreneurs and engineers over the past decades that have continuously and steadily improved this technology, it's one of the bright lights of humanity these days.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/maine-jury-clears-avangrids-145-mile-transmission-line-reversing-ballot-v/648209/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.utilitydive.com/news/maine-jury-clears-avangrids...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This title is inaccurate. What they are disallowing are users using ChatGPT to offer legal and medical advice to other people. First parties can still use ChatGPT for medical and legal advice for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in rail safety. Two major non-Chinese train companies attempted to merge a few years ago, explicitly to build a company that could compete with China's national company, and provide safer alternatives to state-sponsored cyberhacking of Western rail.&lt;p&gt;It fell down to an anti-monopoly decision by a single person in the EU ministry, who killed the proposal. Several attempts were made to streamline the merger, but she wouldn't budge.&lt;p&gt;As a result, CRCC continues to win contracts abroad, largely (it is believed) by undercutting competition. IP theft is known to be one objective of their at-loss or low-profit contracts (I've been involved in fighting that, specifically).&lt;p&gt;It's hardly a stretch to imagine that having control of the rail in countries that might oppose you militarily is strategically huge.&lt;p&gt;This article is about busways, but the parallels are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

Anybody else?"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Many (most?) older retail businesses still use TUIs. They're reliable, consistent, and &lt;i&gt;orders of magnitude&lt;/i&gt; faster than GUI systems.&lt;p&gt;When I worked ar Sherwin Williams, I got good enough with the TUI that customers could rattle off their orders while I punch it into the computer in real time.&lt;p&gt;It's absolutely crazy that a well designed TUI is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much faster. It turns out that if you &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; change the UI and &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; menu item &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; has the same hotkey, navigating the software becomes muscle memory and your speed is only limited by how fast you can physically push the buttons.&lt;p&gt;The program had many menu options added and removed over the decades, but the crucial part is that the hotkeys and menu indexes &lt;i&gt;never, ever&lt;/i&gt; changed. Once you learn that you can pop into a quick order menu with this specific sequence of five keys, you just automatically open the right menu the moment a customer walks up. No thought, just pure reflex.&lt;p&gt;UX absolutely peaked with TUIs several decades ago. No graphical interface I've ever seen comes even close to the raw utility and speed of these finely tuned TUIs. There is a very, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good reason that the oldest and wealthiest retail businesses still use this ancient software. It works, and it's staggeringly effective, and any conceivable replacement will only be worse. There simply is no effective way to improve it.&lt;p&gt;Edit: I will say that these systems take time and effort to learn. You have to commit these UI paths to memory, which isn't too hard, but in order to be maximally effective, you also have to memorize a lot of product metadata. But the key is that it really doesn't take longer than your ordinary training period to become minimally effective. After that, you just pick up the muscle memory as you go. It's pretty analogous to learning touch typing without trying. Your hands just learn where the keys are and after enough time your brain translates words into keystrokes without active thought.&lt;p&gt;It's a beautiful way to design maximally effective software. We've really lost something very important with the shift to GUI and the shunning of text mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not as black-and-white as "Brenda good, AI bad". It's much more nuanced than this.&lt;p&gt;When it comes to (traditional) coding, for the most part, when I program a function to do X, every single time I run that function from now until the heat death of the sun, it will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; produce Y. Forever! When it does, we understand why, and when it doesn't, we also &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; understand why it didn't!&lt;p&gt;When I use AI to perform X, every single time I run that AI from now until the heat death of the sun it will &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; produce Y. Forever! When it does, we don't understand why, and when it doesn't, we also don't understand why!&lt;p&gt;We know that Brenda might screw up sometimes but she doesn't run at the speed of light, isn't able to produce a thousand lines of Excel Macro in 3 seconds, doesn't hallucinate (well, let's hope she doesn't), can follow instructions etc. If she does make a mistake, we can find it, fix it, ask her what happened etc. before the damage is too great.&lt;p&gt;In short: when AI does &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; at all, we only have, at best, a rough approximation of why it did it. With Brenda, it only takes a couple of questions to figure it out!&lt;p&gt;Before anyone says I'm against AI, I love it and am neck-deep in it all day when programming (not vibe-coding!) so I have a full understanding of what I'm getting myself into but I also know its limitations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No contradiction here:&lt;p&gt;When we say “machine”, we mean deterministic algorithms and predictable mechanisms.&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is neither of those things (in theory it is deterministic but not for any practical applications).&lt;p&gt;If we order by predictability:&lt;p&gt;Quick Sort &gt; Brenda &gt; Gen AI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give you one reason, among many, it wasn't a failure. It made it illegal to deny people health insurance coverage based on pre existing conditions. That was a big step forward in a broken system to restore some humanity to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guys have it all wrong. There was only one candidate for the dem party, Here's the list:&lt;p&gt;1) Cuomo. Sexpest who has been accused by many women of some pretty shitty stuff. Also a member of a multi-generational dynasty, which is not good.&lt;p&gt;2) Mayor Adams. Federally indicted by the Feds. They have a 99% conviction rate. Not because they're corrupt, but because they only go after people who have dome some really egregious, illegal shit.&lt;p&gt;3) Mamdani. Millennial candidate. No dirt. Other that some stupid stuff he said while he was young, his policies are relatively common sense and middle of the road, and are aimed at leveling the playing field.&lt;p&gt;Gee, who should I choose? [[said all of NYC today]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this win signals (to both parties) that voters are receptive and will get engaged when a clear message is presented about cost of living and quality of life issues. Some of which are taken for granted in most other western countries.&lt;p&gt;I’m no political wonk, and I’m curious what others with more insight might say about his ability to fund and implement his polices.&lt;p&gt;I’m reminided of Obama and his hopeful message but he was mostly stymied on policy goals. Specifically Obamacare as an example ended up being watered down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dislike those black and white takes a lot. It's absolutely true that most startups that just run an EC2 instance will save a lot of cash going to Hetzner, Linode, Digital Ocean or whatever. I do host at Hetzner myself and so do a lot of my clients.&lt;p&gt;That being said, the cloud does have a lot of advantages:&lt;p&gt;- You're getting a lot of services readily available. Need offsite backups? A few clicks. Managed database? A few clicks. Multiple AZs? Available in seconds.&lt;p&gt;- You're not paying up-front costs (vs. investing hundreds of dollars for buying server hardware) and everything is available &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt; [0]&lt;p&gt;- Peak-heavy loads can be a lot cheaper. Mostly irrelevant for you average compute load, but things are quite different if you need to train an LLM&lt;p&gt;- Many services are already certified according to all kinds of standards, which can be very useful depending on your customers&lt;p&gt;Also, engineering time and time in general can be expensive. If you are a solo entrepreneur or a slow growth company, you have a lot of engineering time for basically free. But in a quick growth or prototyping phase, not to speak of venture funding, things can be quite different. Buying engineering time for &gt;150€/hour can quickly offset a lot of saving [1].&lt;p&gt;Does this apply to most companies? No. Obviously not. But the cloud is not too expensive - you're paying for stuff you don't need. That's an entirely different kind of error.&lt;p&gt;[0] Compared to the rack hosting setup described in the post. Hetzner, Linode, etc. do provide multiple AZs with dedicated servers.&lt;p&gt;[1] Just to be fair, debugging cloud errors can be time consuming, too, and experienced AWS engineers will not be cheaper. But an RDS instance with solid backups-equivalent will usually not amortize quickly, if you need to pay someone to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Way to undermine an interesting product launch through poorly chosen language:&lt;p&gt;&gt; Let’s be frank the single‑player notebook has felt outdated for a while now. We’re open‑sourcing its successor. Jupyter belongs in the hall of great ideas — alongside “Hello, world.” and “View Source.”&lt;p&gt;If you're trying to reach out to the Python community this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the way to do it. Completely unnecessary hostile language there! Have some respect.&lt;p&gt;My advice to Deepnote is to scrap this launch announcement (ideally with an apology) and try again. They've built something genuinely useful and interesting but it's going go get a lot less attention than it deserves if they introduce the open source version to the world like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative to the reject and request rewrite approach, which may not work in the corporation environment. You schedule a really long video call with the offending person, with the agenda politely describing that for such a huge and extensive change, a collaborative meeting is required. You then notify your lead that new huge task has arrived which will take X hours from you, so if he wishes to re-prioritize tasks, he is welcome. And then if the meeting happen, you literally go line by line, demanding that author explain them to you. And if explanation or a meeting are refused, you can reject RP with a clear explanation why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked at RSA over a decade ago, we developed Bloom filter-based indexing to speed up querying on a proprietary database that was specialised for storing petabytes of network events and packet data.  I implemented the core Bloom filter-based indexer based on MurmurHash2 functions and I was quite proud of the work I did back then.  The resulting improvement in query performance looked impressive to our customers.  I remember the querying speed went up from roughly 49,000 records per second to roughly 1,490,000 records per second, so nearly a 30-fold increase.&lt;p&gt;However, the performance gain is not surprising at all since Bloom filters allow the querying engine to skip large blocks of data with certainty when the blocks do not contain the target data.  False negatives are impossible.  False positives occur but the rate of false positives can be made very small with well-chosen parameters and trade-offs.&lt;p&gt;With 4 hash functions (k = 4), 10007 bits per bloom filter (m = 10007) and a new bloom filter for every 1000 records (n = 1000), we achieved a theoretical false-positive rate of only 1.18% ((1 - e(-k * n / m)) ^ k = 0.0118).  In practice, over a period of 5 years, we found that the actual false positive rate varied between 1.13% and 1.29%.&lt;p&gt;The only downside of a false positive is that it makes the query engine read a data block unnecessarily to verify whether the target data is present.  This affects performance but not correctness; much like how CPU branch misprediction affects performance but not correctness.&lt;p&gt;A 30-fold increase in querying speed with just 1.25 kB of overhead per data block of 1000 records (each block roughly 1 MB to 2 MB in size) was, in my view, an excellent trade-off.  It made a lot of difference to the customer experience, turning what used to be a 2 minute wait for query results into a wait of just about 5 seconds, or in larger queries, reducing a 30 minute wait to about 1 minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the author is actually wrong. The date is not 5 years before you submit, but is 5 years before the form is received by the home office! So there are a few days of uncertainty, depending on how fast Royal Mail was with the physical documents.&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I did a request for my information from the home office prior to filling in my form. After all, you have the right to request the information they have on you that will be used to verify your form. Kafka would be proud.&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you, Home Office doesn't have a clue where you were 5 years ago. It had approximately 50% of my trips, and frequently only had only one leg of the journey. Plane, ferry, train, sailboat, ... it didn't matter. It seems like they have not been keeping the information very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see how being critical of this is a knee jerk response.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thinking&lt;/i&gt;, like &lt;i&gt;intelligence&lt;/i&gt; and many other words designating complex things, isn’t a simple topic. The word and concept developed in a world where it referred to human beings, and in a lesser sense, to animals.&lt;p&gt;To simply disregard that entire conceptual history and say, “well it’s doing a thing that looks like thinking, ergo it’s thinking” is the lazy move. What’s really needed is an analysis of what &lt;i&gt;thinking&lt;/i&gt; actually means, as a word. Unfortunately everyone is loathe to argue about definitions, even when that is fundamentally what this is all about.&lt;p&gt;Until that conceptual clarification happens, you can expect endless messy debates with no real resolution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea travel was this difficult for people who aren't EU citizens.&lt;p&gt;Wow, I'm almost annoyed on the authors behalf of how much hoops there are to jump through.&lt;p&gt;&gt;To apply for British citizenship, you need to prove you were physically in the UK on your application date but five years ago. Not approximately five years, not that week—that exact day when you press "submit" on the form minus five years. Miss it by 24 hours and your application is reject after months of waiting, and you have to pay a hefty fee to re-apply.&lt;p&gt;That's a hilarious requirement. I wonder how that ended up in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; buy a sausage roll at Greggs&lt;p&gt;If that's the first thing he thinks of while transiting through a UK airport, he deserves a citizenship, no questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author makes an error while explaining Jevons’ Paradox. They say “the cheaper and faster we got at producing coal, the more coal we ended up using”. But that’s not paradoxical at all. That’s basic supply and demand curve from economics 101. It’s exactly what you’d expect.&lt;p&gt;Whereas if you take the extraordinarily difficult step of opening Wikipedia (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox&lt;/a&gt;), you understand the real paradox. Jevons observed that when &lt;i&gt;steam engines&lt;/i&gt; get more efficient and individually use less coal, we end up deploying many more steam engines in many new industries and use cases, increasing coal consumption overall.&lt;p&gt;This seems like a basic oversight, maybe this guy hasn’t heard of Wikipedia. On the other hand, I think he wants to push the narrative that AI is seeing enormous productivity gains. He does this by using price per token, which has fallen. Very similar to Jevons supposedly observing “coal production”. But the author is struggling to point to new industries and use cases that were opened up by AI, like when we deployed steam engines back in the 1860s. So he misstates Jevons paradox, removes the paradoxical part, and makes it seem like his thesis makes sense.&lt;p&gt;Jevons’ Paradox could still apply here! I’m not saying it doesn’t. But we just haven’t seen the examples quite yet. A good example would be an observed surge in demand custom built software as software engineers become more efficient. But lower token costs ain’t it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; I look forward to the "personal computing" period, with small models distributed everywhere...&lt;p&gt;One could argue that this period was just a brief fluke. Personal computers really took off only in the 1990s, web 2.0 happened in the mid-2000s. Now, for the average person, 95%+ of screen time boils down to using the computer as a dumb terminal to access centralized services "in the cloud".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost posted something this morning about this, because I received an email that really frustrated me. I have a 401k with Guideline from an old employer. The email was from Accrue &lt;no-reply@accrue401k.com&gt;, and said, in part:&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Login: Please visit my.accrue401k.com to log in. You’ll find that the 401(k) dashboard and user experience remain familiar. If you’ve set up your account, your same login credentials will provide you access into the dashboard. (Please note, Accrue does not currently offer a mobile app).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;The my.accrue401k.com part was a hyperlink to that site. I've independently done some digging (and contacted my old employer to verify!) but this is precisely how a targeted phishing attack would work. Asking someone to enter their financial account credentials into a site they've never used or heard of, based entirely on an unsolicited email, is INSANE.&lt;p&gt;This email was the first time I've heard of Gusto, of Guideline being acquired, or of Accrue 401k (which apparently is the company created to hold Guideline's 401k accounts that are NOT affiliated with Gusto). Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
