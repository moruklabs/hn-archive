&lt;p&gt;This is gonna be game-changing for the next 2-4 weeks before they nerf the model.&lt;p&gt;Then for the next 2-3 months people complaining about the degradation will be labeled “skill issue”.&lt;p&gt;Then a sacrificial Anthropic engineer will “discover” a couple obscure bugs that “in some cases” might have lead to less than optimal performance. Still largely a user skill issue though.&lt;p&gt;Then a couple months later they’ll release Opus 4.7 and go through the cycle again.&lt;p&gt;My allegiance to these companies is now measured in nerf cycles.&lt;p&gt;I’m a nerf cycle customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burying of the lede here is insane. $5/$25 per MTok is a 3x price drop from Opus 4. At that price point, Opus stops being "the model you use for important things" and becomes actually viable for production workloads.&lt;p&gt;Also notable: they're claiming SOTA prompt injection resistance. The industry has largely given up on solving this problem through training alone, so if the numbers in the system card hold up under adversarial testing, that's legitimately significant for anyone deploying agents with tool access.&lt;p&gt;The "most aligned model" framing is doing a lot of heavy lifting though. Would love to see third-party red team results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, they are basically confirming Android and Apple have their backdoors as no arrests or seizures on that matter have taken place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think your devices should have government-mandated backdoors if and only if you are a public servant. I don't understand why private citizens are held to higher standards of conduct than politicians and cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProTip: use PNPM, not NPM.
PNPM 10.x shutdown a lot of these attack vectors.&lt;p&gt;1. Does not default to running post-install scripts (must manually approve each)&lt;p&gt;2. Let's you set a min age for new releases before `pnpm install` will pull them in - e.g. 4 days - so publishers have time to cleanup.&lt;p&gt;NPM is too insecure for production CLI usage.&lt;p&gt;And of course make a very limited scope publisher key, bind it to specific packages (e.g. workflow A can only publish pkg A), and IP bound it to your self hosted CI/CD runners. No one should have publish keys on their local, and even if they got the publish keys, they couldn't publish from local.
(Granted, GHA fans can use OIDC Trusted Publishers as well, but tokens done well are just as secure)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, djb has been doing and saying these things since he was a college student:&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    While a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, Bernstein completed the development of an encryption equation (an "algorithm") he calls "Snuffle." Bernstein wishes to publish a) the algorithm (b) a mathematical paper describing and explaining the algorithm and (c) the "source code" for a computer program that incorporates the algorithm. Bernstein also wishes to discuss these items at mathematical conferences, college classrooms and other open public meetings. The Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the ITAR regulatory scheme) required Bernstein to submit his ideas about cryptography to the government for review, to register as an arms dealer, and to apply for and obtain from the government a license to publish his ideas. Failure to do so would result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Bernstein believes this is a violation of his First Amendment rights and has sued the government. 

    After four years and one regulatory change, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that software source code was speech protected by the First Amendment and that the government's regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are all the comments here so weird? It's like people saw (but didn't read) an article entitled "Man Opens a Taqueria in his Hometown" and the only responses are&lt;p&gt;1) Why didn't he open it in &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; hometown? This location isn't convenient for me.&lt;p&gt;2) Wouldn't it be better for someone else to open a taqueria instead? My cousin is looking for work. Shouldn't we be putting resources into helping him open a restaurant instead?&lt;p&gt;It's like people hear "X in Asian country" and all they can think about is their own geopolitical narrative fed to them by the US state department. Obviously Japan is going to want to develop lucrative manufacturing... within Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "use cooldown" [0] blog post looks particularly relevant today.&lt;p&gt;I'd argue automated dependency updates pose a greater risk than one-day exploits, though I don't have data to back that up. That's harder to undo a compromised package already in thousands of lock files, than to manually patch a already exploited vulnerability in your dependencies.&lt;p&gt;[0] &lt;a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using-dependency-cooldowns" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not "node" or "Javascript" the problem, it's this convenient packaging model.&lt;p&gt;This is gonna ruffle some feathers, but it's only a matter of time until it'll happen on the Rust ecosystem which loves to depend on a billion subpackages, and it won't be fault of the language itself.&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, the more I believe that C, C++ or Odin's decision not to have a convenient package manager that fosters a cambrian explosion of dependencies to be a very good idea security-wise. Ambivalent about Go: they have a semblance of packaging system, but nothing so reckless like allowing third-party tarballs uploaded in the cloud to effectively run code on the dev's machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;co-founder of PostHog here. We were a victim of this attack. We had a bunch of packages published a couple of hours ago. The main packages/versions affected were:&lt;p&gt;- posthog-node 4.18.1, 5.13.3 and 5.11.3&lt;p&gt;- posthog-js 1.297.3&lt;p&gt;- posthog-react-native 4.11.1&lt;p&gt;- posthog-docusaurus 2.0.6&lt;p&gt;We've rotated keys and passwords, unpublished all affected packages and have pushed new versions, so make sure you're on the latest version of our SDKs.&lt;p&gt;We're still figuring out how this key got compromised, and we'll follow up with a post-mortem. We'll update status.posthog.com with more updates as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Meta employee here. I worked at reality labs, perhaps in other orgs the situation is different.&lt;p&gt;At Meta we did "fix-it weeks", more or less every quarter. At the beginning I was thrilled: leadership that actually cares about fixing bugs!&lt;p&gt;Then reality hit: it's the worst possible decision for code and software quality. Basically this turned into: you are allowed to land all the possible crap you want. Then you have one week to "fix all the bugs". Guess what: most of the time we couldn't even fix a single bug because we were drown in tech debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they resisted because it was completely ridiculous waste of engineering resources all over the country and for absolutely no tangible reason other than white people trying to feel better about themselves.&lt;p&gt;I work in the field of film mastering (with countless product names with the word “master” in it) and luckily no one got the ridiculous idea in their head that we need to change this lingo.&lt;p&gt;Show me a single person who has a valid reason for me not calling my branch “master” or my bedroom “the master”. I honestly think this sort of ridiculing word policing is why we lost this last damned election. And if you’re somehow proud that you’ve renamed your git branches, you’re very likely a contributor to that lost election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorta related since Disney held a share in it previously but Dick Tracy exclusive rights are still held by Warren Beatty who produced and starred in the role back in 1990. He had to fight off a challenge from Tribune Media in court decades ago but stipulation was he had to produce new Dick Tracy stuff every few years. It’s lead to a series of increasingly surreal late night specials on TCM where he appears in character and talks about random stuff and the 1990 movie, last time was in 2023: &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MwKncYwtec4" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MwKncYwtec4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a good thing, if it would cause anything to change. It obviously won't. As if a single person reading this post wasn't aware that the Internet is centralized, and couldn't name specifically a few sources of centralization (Cloudflare, AWS, Gmail, Github). As if it's the first time this happens. As if after the last time AWS failed (or the one before that, or one before…) anybody stopped using AWS. As if anybody &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; viably stop using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the idea, but this line:&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; 1) no bug should take over 2 days&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is odd. It’s virtually impossible for me to estimate how long it will take to fix a bug, until the job is done.&lt;p&gt;That said, unless fixing a bug requires a significant refactor/rewrite, I can’t imagine spending more than a day on one.&lt;p&gt;Also, I tend to attack bugs by priority/severity, as opposed to difficulty.&lt;p&gt;Some of the most serious bugs are often quite easy to find.&lt;p&gt;Once I find the cause of a bug, the fix is usually just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

Traffic cleared, and so did the air"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;&gt; Big-city transit has an equilibrium point, and it is incredibly stable. Every serious transit city in the world ends up in the same place&lt;p&gt;You're cherry-picking your own examples. It worked in Iowa City.&lt;p&gt;Y Combinator and much of SV would be out of business if innovators followed that thinking. One reason is that people do come up with new ideas; that's how the world changes. The other is that the world changes, and what didn't work before now works - costs change and value changes, and now it's worthwhile. For example, with congestion pricing and other rapidly increasong costs of NYC car ownership, there's more value in free transit.&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it's the thinking advocated by many HN posts, denigrating the innovation under discussion as impossible, useless, etc.&lt;p&gt;&gt; without sustainability, a political shift will kill it&lt;p&gt;That can be said of many things. A political shift could kill military funding in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew some people that were initially very optimistic, and I tried to keep an open mind when DOGE got started despite the outlandish claims that they would be able to cut $2 trillion dollars from the budget, but it's apparent at this point that the project has been an extreme failure. It'll probably take a few years to really sort out their damage and overall impact though.&lt;p&gt;It's also imperative to mention in every DOGE-related discussion and conversation that the funding freeze to USAID is directly responsible for killing thousands of people [0]. Most of the damage done by DOGE can probably be reversed, but the thousands of death as a direct result of actions taken by the richest man in the world should not be forgotten. (Although I'm told there is a bit of uncertainty with any specific figures because the funding disruption also impacted the mechanisms for tracking and reporting deaths.)&lt;p&gt;[0] &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has its issues and there are plenty of things to not like about Rust, but this article is giving me the impression that this person has not written much Rust. Unfortunately, many such cases with Rust criticism.&lt;p&gt;&gt; Memory safety is not that sacred. In fact, for many applications malfunctioning is better than crashing — particulary in the embedded world where Rust wants to be present. You cannot get 99.999% reliability with Rust — it crashes all the time.&lt;p&gt;Yeah until that memory safety issue causes memory corruption in a completely different area of code and suddenly you're wasting time debugging difficult-to-diagnose crashes once they do start to surface.&lt;p&gt;&gt; We actually had a recent Cloudflare outage caused by a crash on unwrap() function: &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were multiple failures before that `unwrap()` and the argument can easily be made that this is no different than an unchecked exception or a release assertion.&lt;p&gt;&gt; Sync/Send, Mutex and reference counting (Arc)? Unfortuantely, those lock or simply mess with CPU caches badly, so they are inefficient for multithreaded communication, at least an intensive one. They are safe, but inefficient. Which kinda destroys the first uncompromising thing in Rust — performance.&lt;p&gt;Doing this the "correct" way in other languages has similar impact? So I'm not sure why Rust forcing you to do the correct thing which causes perf issues is uniquely a Rust issue. Doing this the "just get it done" way in other languages will likely come back to bite you eventually even if it does unblock you temporarily.&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of times I did a `static mut` global in Rust just to get some shit done and oops, accidentally hit some UB as the project grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been a Windows user since 3.1; and I've even defended Microsoft in the past (particularly when they made unpopular choices, but for technically correct reasons, like UAC or forcing vendors to rewrite their drivers into userland or using a safer driver model).&lt;p&gt;BUT, I won't defend Windows 11 and Microsoft's general direction. I feel like there has been a slow cultural shift within Microsoft, from a core of fantastic engineers surrounding by marketing/sales, to the org's direction being set by marketing/sales UX be damned.&lt;p&gt;Plus it feels like a lot of the technical expertise retired out, and left a bunch of engineers scared to touch core systems instead preferring to build on top using Web tech. It means that Windows/Office stopped improving, and have actually both regressed significantly.&lt;p&gt;I've actually found myself recommending MacOS, particularly the prior generation of Macbook Airs which are absurdly powerful with absurd battery life for a fair price. Combine that with the lack of user hostility, and UX, that MacOS brings relative to Windows 11, and it is hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typography nerds are some of my favourite nerds.&lt;p&gt;Font specimen pages are so often screaming with design language and intention, they push and prod to evoke and present.&lt;p&gt;Maybe the secret has something to do with the lack of priority to the actual content; just present the font gosh-darn!&lt;p&gt;Looks nicely executed within the confines of the inspiration. very cool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ouch. This hits incredibly hard.&lt;p&gt;I’ve been this dad who sits frozen at the TV every evening. I had the affairs with the emotionally unavailable men, and became one myself.&lt;p&gt;Before you judge the man in this story too harshly — and there’s certainly much to judge, especially given the follow-up post — consider the environment he and I grew up in. Being gay as a young teenager in the early 1990s could feel literally like a death sentence. AIDS panic was everywhere. Gay men in movies were comedy sidekicks or dying wrecks (“Philadelphia”). There was a real threat of violence from other kids. If you could pass as straight, why wouldn’t you give it your best shot? The alternative was to be a laughing stock and die alone in a hospital where nurses don’t dare touch you. (This is literally how I imagined gay life at age 13.)&lt;p&gt;I still feel like I’m barely getting started on the therapy journey to recover from those decades. Seems like the man in the story never had the chance for professional help (or didn’t seek it). The compartmentalization can be extremely taxing. He disappointed many people, but that doesn’t mean he was a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a dad too, and I'm in a somewhat similar situation. My son is under five, and it feels like I'm still at the very beginning of his story. I've known I was gay since high school, probably even earlier, but I kept choosing whatever seemed like the easiest path. It felt easier to stay closeted. Easier to date a woman. Easier to move in together, propose, get married, and even have a child than to face my truth.&lt;p&gt;I love my wife and my son, and I feel loved by them in return, but I'm also painfully aware that the version of me they love is someone I constructed. I lie constantly: about why I don't want sex, about my affairs, about my feelings, about my motivations. No one really knows me, and I don't get to be myself, not even in the relationships where I should feel safest.&lt;p&gt;I've read &lt;i&gt;The Courage to Be Disliked&lt;/i&gt; by Ichiro Kishimi and other similar books, and I'm trying to build the courage to finally do something about all of this. It's incredibly difficult. But I refuse to use my son as an excuse to keep postponing coming out. This blog has pushed me even further in that direction.&lt;p&gt;They'll be angry (well at least my wife). Their lives will be upended. But at least they'll have the chance to ask questions, to understand. They'll see me taking responsibility for the consequences of my choices, and maybe just maybe, in some way, that clarity will be a relief for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From reading both posts, there's a few things that come to my mind:&lt;p&gt;- It seems this is how the author is processing her father's passing, and it's not really up to us to make moral calls on the content of the posts. They are thoughts with gaps of missing context against a real life of highs and lows which is not readily condensed into a blog post.&lt;p&gt;- I'm peering into the life of a private person, that feels like a violation. Even though they have passed, the people around them are very much alive.&lt;p&gt;- We can't makes guesses at what a person truly values, neither positively nor negatively. What can be seen as promiscuity can also be seen as seeking validation, human motives and emotions exist in the grey area.&lt;p&gt;- This is a person who was deprived of the sort of genuine sexual and emotional attention that we take for granted from puberty age. They lived as a type of outsider in school, work, and their daily norms. The integrity of their actions shouldn't be evaluated against our own values which were likely built from a different life experience.&lt;p&gt;- It's ok not knowing or judging. One has to practice a type of "radical acceptance" when reviewing these sorts of life matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently had to deal with my father cognitive decline &amp; falling for scams left &amp; right using Meta’s apps. This has been so hard on our family. I did a search the other day on marketplace and 100% of all sellers were scams, 20-30 of them.&lt;p&gt;Meta is a cancer on our society, I’m shutting down all my accounts. Back when TV/Radio/News paper were how you consumed news, you couldn’t get scams this bad at this scale. Our parents dealt with their parents so much easier as they cognitively declined. We need legal protections for elders and youth online more than ever. Companies need to be liable for their ads and scam accounts. Then you’d see a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comment at the bottom of the article I believe is correct.  I believe this because our neighborhood had the same problem.  One day my neighbor,  frustrated beyond his capacity,  and seemingly very high on something,  went outside and started ripping infrastructure out by hand and damaging everything else he could find with a hammer.&lt;p&gt;They came out and replaced a lot of the damaged equipment and did a few upgrades.  After that the intermittent 2 minute drop problems disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a fascinating and redacted interview with an "anonymous" subject about the disaster. To say the least it's an unsuccessful attempt to hide the identity of the individual:&lt;p&gt;"Q. So how did you get yourself started into submersible operations?&lt;p&gt;A. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with my film Titanic. When I set down the path to make that film, the first thing that I did was arrange to be introduced to the head of the submersible program at the P.P.

&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with the author. I remain on Charter’s shitlist to this day because I had a very similar issue about twenty years ago, except our connection cut out entirely after ~10MB of data had downloaded in a continuous stream, and the cable modem had to wait for the line to become available again. No amount of technical documentation, logs, traceroutes, equipment swaps, or anything on my end would convince them it was a problem with their infrastructure.&lt;p&gt;So, exasperated, I filed a complaint with the FCC. A week later, it got fixed along with an apology, no truck roll needed.&lt;p&gt;I miss when the government had teeth and used it against companies, man.&lt;/p&gt;
