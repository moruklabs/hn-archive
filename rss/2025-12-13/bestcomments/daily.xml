After 27 years, his quest is nearly over"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I looked this up and it completely ruined it for me:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://refuga.com/karl-bushby-the-man-who-chose-to-walk-around-the-world/?lang=en" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://refuga.com/karl-bushby-the-man-who-chose-to-walk-aro...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is how much he had to sacrifice. Leaving his only son when he was just five and not being able to watch him grow up like any other normal father. He also sacrificed a father/son relationship that may never be restored. “Out of everyone I knew in this world, I knew my son least of all.” Karl didn’t have any means of communication with his son for years but managed to reach him after contacting one of his friends on Facebook. While he was away, his son was suffering from depression and self abuse and had to use medication and therapy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not sacrifice, that's abandonment. I have a young son not far from that age and trying to imagine how he'd feel if daddy just walked off nearly brings me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best models are already nearly as good as you can be for a large fraction of what I personally use them for, which is basically as a more efficient search engine.&lt;p&gt;The thing that would now make the biggest difference isn't "more intelligence", whatever that might mean, but better grounding.&lt;p&gt;It's still a big issue that the models will make up plausible sounding but wrong or misleading explanations for things, and verifying their claims ends up taking time. And if it's a topic you don't care about enough, you might just end up misinformed.&lt;p&gt;I think Google/Gemini realize this, since their "verify" feature is designed to address exactly this. Unfortunately it hasn't worked very well for me so far.&lt;p&gt;But to me it's very clear that the product that gets this right will be the one I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic to my blog plummeted this year and you can never be entirely sure how it happened. But here are two culprits i identified.&lt;p&gt;1. Ai overview: my page impressions were high, my ranking was high, but click through took a dive. People read the generated text and move along without ever clicking.&lt;p&gt;2. You are now a spammer. Around August, traffic took a second plunge. In my logs, I noticed these weird queries in my search page. Basically people were searching for crypto and scammy websites on my blog. Odd, but not like they were finding anything. Turns out, their search query was displayed as an h1 on the page and crawled by google. I was basically displaying spam.&lt;p&gt;I don't have much control over ai overview because disabling it means I don't appear in search at all. But for the spam, I could do something. I added a robot noindex on the search page. A week later, both impressions and clicks recovered.&lt;p&gt;Edit: Adding write up I did a couple weeks ago &lt;a href="https://idiallo.com/blog/how-i-became-a-spammer" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://idiallo.com/blog/how-i-became-a-spammer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GNU's version of Yacc is called Bison. Pine Is Not Elm (even though that was never an official acronym). UNIX was UNICS which was a pun on MULTICS. I couldn't for the life of me tell you what dd stands for. nano is a copy of pico which was the "PIne COmposer". Postfix is a completely opaque portmanteau of post (as in mail) and "bug fix". C++ is "C incremented", and C is the successor of B, which is the successor of BCPL.&lt;p&gt;Developers haven't "lost the plot", we never had it in the first place.&lt;p&gt;Inversely, Clang, LLDB, jq, fzf, loc are modern projects perfectly in line with the author's notion of a good name. "mise-en-place" is the perfect metaphor for what mise does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, they built their digital ID so that third parties could verify attributes (it's NOT just a single-service login across government + a linking ID across government services, which is how it was sold by the BBC).&lt;p&gt;They're pretty close to completely de-anonymising the internet for UK citizens. Say they introduce an Australian-style social media ban for under 16s, then requires all social media to link their accounts to digital IDs for this verification.&lt;p&gt;Naturally the only remaining loophole is if a UK citizen manages to avoid being flagged as British ever by using a VPN, so I expect they will focus on that going forwards. Keep in mind the UK already arrests and imprisons vast numbers of people for speech offences, there's no slippery-slope argument here because the UK is already at the bottom of the slope as an ultra-authoratitarian anti-speech nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Server Components always felt uncomfortable to me because they make it hard to look at a piece of JavaScript code and derive which parts of it are going to run on the client and which parts will run on the server.&lt;p&gt;It turns out this introduces another problem too: in order to get that to work you need to implement some kind of DEEP serialization RPC mechanism - which is kind of opaque to the developer and, as we've recently seen, is a risky spot in terms of potential security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; grep (global regular expression print), awk (Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan; the creators’ initials), sed (stream editor), cat (concatenate), diff (difference). Even when abbreviated, these names were either functional descriptions or systematic derivations.&lt;p&gt;If you asked someone unfamiliar with unix tools what they thought each of these commands did, diff is the only one which they would have even the slightest chance of guessing. It's ridiculous to complain about "libsodium" and then hold up "awk" as a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this is as good a place as any to mention this. I've now met two different devs who complained about the weird responses from their LLM of choice, and it turned out they were using a single session for everything. From recipes for the night, presents for the wife and then into programming issues the next day.&lt;p&gt;Don't do that. The whole context is sent on queries to the LLM, so start a new chat for each topic. Or you'll start being told what your wife thinks about global variables and how to cook your Go.&lt;p&gt;I realise this sounds obvious to many people but it clearly wasn't to those guys so maybe it's not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comment section is strange, a lot of people trying to discredit Snowden, saying he shouldn't have released the files, should be in prison, etc. 12 years ago this was HUGE news and had a major impact on the internet and everyone thanked Snowden for these documents! I certainly am thankful. Disappointed in my country that they literally said that "spying between friends is a no-go" but then did nothing and intimidated journalists and legalized it instead. And thanks to the author for giving the documents another look, found it very interesting.

&lt;p&gt;This keeps coming up and we keep having the same debates about what Age Verification isn't.&lt;p&gt;For the folks in the back row:&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Age Verification isn't about Kids or Censorship, It's about Surveillance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Age Verification isn't about Kids or Censorship, It's about Surveillance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Age Verification isn't about Kids or Censorship, It's about Surveillance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without even reaching for my tinfoil hat, the strategy at work here is clear [0 1 2].  If we have to know that you're not a minor, then we also have to know who you are so we can make any techniques to obfuscate that illegal.  By turning this from "keep an eye on your kids" to "prove you're not a kid" they've created the conditions to make privacy itself illegal.&lt;p&gt;VPNs are next.  Then PGP.  Then anything else that makes it hard for them to know who you are, what you say, and who you say it to.&lt;p&gt;Please, please don't fall into the trap and start discussing whether or not this is going to be effective to protect kids.  It isn't, and that isn't the point.&lt;p&gt;0 &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpns-and-they-have-no-idea-what-theyre-doing" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpn...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpn-usage-at-risk-in-michigan-under-new-proposed-adult-content-law" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpn-usage...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 &lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-09-15/debates/57714CE6-0CE4-49F6-B028-E271D5100F7F/OnlineSafetyAct2023VirtualPrivateNetworks" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2025-09-15/debates/57714...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Only downsides are in the polish department&lt;p&gt;What an understatement. It has me thinking „man, fuck this“ on the daily.&lt;p&gt;Just today it spontaneously lost &lt;i&gt;an entire 20-30 minutes long thread&lt;/i&gt; and it was far from the first time. It basically does it any time you interrupt it in any way. It’s straight up data loss.&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of a typical Google product in that it feels more like a tech demo than a product.&lt;p&gt;It has &lt;i&gt;theoretically&lt;/i&gt; great tech. I particularly like the idea of voice mode, but it’s noticeably glitchy, breaks spontaneously often &lt;i&gt;and keeps asking annoying questions which you can’t make it stop&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using chatGPT a ton over the last months and paying the subscription. Used it for coding, news, stock analysis, daily problems, and a whatever I could think of. I decided to give Gemini a go when version three came out to great reviews. Gemini handles every single one of my uses cases much better and consistently gives better answers. This is especially true for situations were searching the web for current information is important, makes sense that google would be better. Also OCR is phenomenal chatgpt can't read my bad hand writing but Gemini can easily. Only downsides are in the polish department, there are more app bugs and I usually have to leave the happen or the session terminates. There are bugs with uploading photos. The biggest complaint is that all links get inserted into google search and then I have to manipulate them when they should go directly to the chosen website, this has to be some kind of internal org KPI nonsense. Overall, my conclusion is that ChatGPT has lost and won't catch up because of the search integration strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; This would be career suicide in virtually any other technical field.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article would certainly disagree with you:&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Department_of_Defense_and_partner_code_names" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Department_of_Def...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; the Golden Gate Bridge tells you it spans the Golden Gate strait.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that even a meaningful distinction? Does anyone think, "Gee, I'd really like to cross the Golden Gate strait?" or do they think "I want to get to Napa?".&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; The Hoover Dam is a dam, named after the president who commissioned it, not “Project Thunderfall” or “AquaHold.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was actually called the "Boulder Canyon Project" while being built, referred to as "Hoover Dam" even though finished during the Roosevelt administration, officially called "Boulder Dam", and only later officially renamed to "Hoover Dam".&lt;p&gt;The fact that Herbert Hoover initiated the project tells you nothing meaningful about it. Would "Reitzlib" be a better name than "Requests"?&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; If you wrote 100 CLIs, you will never counter with a cobra.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;But out in the real world, you could encounter a Shelby Cobra sports car, Bell AH-1 Cobra chopper, USS Cobra (SP-626) patrol boat, Colt Cobra handgun, etc.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; No chemist wakes up and decides to call it “Steve” because Steve is a funny name and they think it’ll make their paper more approachable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you open your medicine cabinet, do you look for a jar labeled "acetylsalicylic acid", "2-propylvaleric acid", or "N-acetyl-para-aminophenol"? Probably not.&lt;p&gt;It's a bad sign when all of the examples in an article don't even agree with the author's point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude is really good at specific analysis, but really terrible at open-ended problems.&lt;p&gt;"Hey claude, I get this error message: &lt;X&gt;", and it'll often find the root cause quicker than I could.&lt;p&gt;"Hey claude, anything I could do to improve Y?", and it'll struggle beyond the basics that a linter might suggest.&lt;p&gt;It suggested enthusiastically a library for &lt;work domain&gt; and it was all "&lt;i&gt;Recommended&lt;/i&gt;" about it, but when I pointed out that the library had been considered and rejected because &lt;issue&gt;, it understood and wrote up why that library suffered from that issue and why it was therefore unsuitable.&lt;p&gt;There's a significant blind-spot in current LLMs related to blue-sky thinking and creative problem solving. It can do structured problems very well, and it can transform unstructured data very well, but it can't deal with unstructured problems very well.&lt;p&gt;That may well change, so I don't want to embed that thought too deeply into my own priors, because the LLM space seems to evolve rapidly. I wouldn't want to find myself blind to the progress because I write it off from a class of problems.&lt;p&gt;But right now, the best way to help an LLM is have a deep understanding of the problem domain yourself, and just leverage it to do the grunt-work that you'd find boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negativity towards this is wild. A company followed relatively widely accepted industry practice (lots and lots of other games also have huge sizes on disk for the exact same reason), then eventually they decided to do their own independent testing to check whether said common practice actually makes things better or not in their case, found that it didn't, so they reversed it. In addition, they wrote up some nice technical articles on the topic, helping to change the old accepted industry wisdom.&lt;p&gt;This seems great to me. Am I crazy? This feels like it should be Hacker News's bread and butter, articles about "we moved away from Kubernetes/microservices/node.js/serverless/React because we did our own investigation and found that the upsides aren't worth the downsides" tend to do really well here. How is this received so differently?&lt;/p&gt;

And I think that this kind of thing bleeds so heavily into culture that they no longer give a shit about having their characters next to it.&lt;p&gt;They have enough plausible deniability; they did not create the content. I think that's enough for them, in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;buried the lede:&lt;p&gt;&gt; As part of the agreement, Disney will make a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI, and receive warrants to purchase additional equity.&lt;p&gt;I say this with no snark or disdain: Sam has mastered the art of the flywheel.&lt;p&gt;Re licensed ai videos, if anyone wants to see the perspective the C-suites are being sold on, check out this episode of Belloni's The Town, in which they discuss the vision for AI + IP

&lt;p&gt;This will not end well for Disney, there were certain historical characters removed from Sora 2 because people kept making racist videos that are hard to censor, and it became increasingly unhinged. This feels like another circular investment where Disney is hoping to make money back I'm sure. On the other hand, assuming they do the freemium stuff, I look forward to making a few videos of my daughters favorite Disney princesses "talking" to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our studio, LucasFonts, designed Calibri. Here are our CEO Luc(as) de Groot’s thoughts on the matter:&lt;p&gt;The decision to abandon Calibri on the grounds of it being a so-called “wasteful diversity font” is both amusing and regrettable. Calibri was specifically designed to enhance readability on modern computer screens and was selected by Microsoft in 2007 to replace Times New Roman as the default font in the Office suite. There were sound reasons for moving away from Times: Calibri performs exceptionally well at small sizes and on standard office monitors, whereas serif fonts like Times New Roman tend to appear more distorted. While serif fonts are well-suited to high-resolution displays, such as those found on modern smartphones, on typical office screens the serifs introduce unnecessary visual noise and can be particularly problematic for users with impaired vision, such as older adults.&lt;p&gt;Professional typography can be achieved with both serif and sans-serif fonts. However, Times New Roman—a typeface older than the current president—presents unique challenges. Originally crafted in Great Britain for newspaper printing, Times was optimised for paper, with each letterform meticulously cut and tested for specific sizes. In the digital era, larger size drawings were repurposed as models, resulting in a typeface that appears too thin and sharp when printed at high quality.&lt;p&gt;Serif fonts are often perceived as more traditional, but they are also more demanding to use effectively. While a skilled typographer can, in theory, produce excellent results with Times, using it in its default digital form is not considered professional practice.&lt;p&gt;Calibri, by contrast, incorporates extensive spacing adjustments and language-specific refinements. The digital version of Times New Roman, developed in the early days of computing, offers only minimal kerning and letter-pair adjustments. This is especially evident in words set in all capitals—such as “CHICAGO”—where the spacing is inconsistent: the letters “HIC” are tightly packed, while “CAG” are spaced too far apart. Microsoft cannot rectify these issues without altering the appearance of existing documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calibri was supposedly easier to read by people with disabilities. While this itself is debatable, that's not the reasoning behind the font switch. The mere &lt;i&gt;attempt&lt;/i&gt; at making life easier for disadvantaged people is labeled DEI and as such cannot be tolerated by this administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently (vibe)-coding some games with my kid, and we wanted some basic text-to-speech functionality. We tested Google's Gemini models in-browser, and they worked great, so we figured we'd add them to the app. Some fun learnings:&lt;p&gt;1. You can access those models via three APIs: the Gemini API (which it turns out is only for prototyping and returned errors 30% of the time), the Vertex API (much more stable but lacking in some functionality), and the TTS API (which performed very poorly despite offering the same models). They also have separate keys (at least, Gemini vs Vertex).&lt;p&gt;2. Each of those APIs supports different parameters (things like language, whether you can pass a style prompt separate from the words you want spoken, etc). None of them offered the full combination we wanted.&lt;p&gt;3. To learn this, you have to spend a couple hours reading API docs, or alternatively, just have Claude Code read the docs then try all different combinations and figure out what works and what doesn't (with the added risk that it might hallucinate something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is not about vibe coding per se, it's about not having strong boundaries between you as the developer, and your client. You should not be allowing the client to dictate how you work, much less them having the permissions to merge in code. This was true before AI too, where clients might say, do X this way, and you should simply say no, because they are paying for &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; expertise*. It's like hiring a plumber then trying to tell them how to fix the toilet.&lt;p&gt;*as an aside, this reminds me of the classic joke where the client asks for the price list for a developer's services:&lt;p&gt;I do it: $500&lt;p&gt;I do it, but you watch: $750&lt;p&gt;I do it, and you help: $1,000&lt;p&gt;You do it yourself: $5,000&lt;p&gt;You start it, and you want me to finish it: $10,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's always annoyed me that zooming in on a building will not reliably show the business that operates there. I understand that at low zoom levels you may need to filter what is displayed based on the high density, but when I zoom in I want to see everything that is there. Sometimes I am forced to go to street view to read the sign, then type the company name into the search box to force the business marker to show up and get clickable.&lt;p&gt;I've found Apple Maps is a little better in this regard. They show a higher density of business markers at any given zoom level.&lt;/p&gt;
