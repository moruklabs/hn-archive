&lt;p&gt;OK, so the "Storing data in the network ... " title made me remember something.&lt;p&gt;If you transmit a message to Mars, say a rover command sequence, and the outgoing buffer is deleted on the sending side (the original code is preserved, but the transmission-encoded sequence doesn't stick around), then that data, for 20-90 minutes, exists nowhere _except_ space. It's just random-looking electrical fluctuations that are propagating through whatever is out there until it hits a conducting piece of metal millions of miles away and energizes a cap bank enough to be measured by a digital circuit and reconstructed into data.&lt;p&gt;So, if you calculate the data rate (9600 baud, even), and set up a loopback/echo transmitter on Mars, you could store ~4 MB "in space".  If you're using lasers, it's &gt;100x as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine received a double shipment for a $300 order. Being honest, he contacted customer service to arrange a return. Everything seemed fine until a few days later when he noticed they had also refunded his original payment. He reached out again to let them know, and they said they’d just recharge his card. Apparently, that transaction failed (no clear reason why), and without any warning, they banned his account, wiping out his entire Kindle library in the process. Amazon works wonderfully right up until it fails spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d advise anyone buying e-books on Amazon to think it through carefully. My account was banned recently because, years ago, I ordered two paper books that Amazon said would be split into two shipments. Both books arrived without any issues, but later Amazon refunded me for one of them, claiming that one package never arrived. This happened 4–5 years ago.&lt;p&gt;Apparently, during a recent review, they decided this counted as fraud and banned my account. As a result, I can no longer log in and lost access to all my Kindle e-books. They also remotely wiped my Kindle, so my entire library is gone. I appealed the decision, but I’ve been waiting for over six months with no resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people screaming "but AI is the future" doesn't recognize what the problem is. The problem is not AI. The problem is that Mozilla keeps jumping on fads instead of focusing on their browser core. There are a tons of "we bundled all the latest crap" Chrome forks out there. Nobody needs more those. Stop pushing bells and whistles. Give us more extensibility instead. Keep supporting v2 manifest and add more. There were genuine technical reasons for why XUL and NPAPI had to die, but we need an equally powerful alternative.&lt;p&gt;And yea, having a faint through about removing adblock support, yet alone speaking it aloud is a really bad sign for Mozilla's future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in CPU security and it's the same with microarchitecture. You wanna know if a machine is vulnerable to a certain issue?&lt;p&gt;- The technical experts (including Intel engineers) will say something like "it affects Blizzard Creek and Windy Bluff models'&lt;p&gt;- Intel's technical docs will say "if CPUID leaf 0x3aa asserts bit 63 then the CPU is affected". (There is no database for this you can only find it out by actually booting one up).&lt;p&gt;- The spec sheet for the hardware calls it a "Xeon Osmiridium X36667-IA"&lt;p&gt;Absolutely none of these forms of naming have any way to correlate between them. They also have different names for the same shit depending on whether it's a consumer or server chip.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, AMD's part numbers contain a digit that increments with each year but is off-by-one with regard to the "Zen" brand version.&lt;p&gt;Usually I just ask the LLM and accept that it's wrong 20% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really not a fan of this direction for Apple. One of the differentiators between iOS and Google was a lack of ads, which make the experience feel more premium. Increasing ads, or having them at all, really erodes the user experience.&lt;p&gt;Apple managed to become the most valuable company in the world without ads. Adding them after hitting that milestone feels either greedy or desperate, maybe a little of both. I know the ads themselves aren’t new, but the steady increase is a worrying trend.&lt;p&gt;I’d rather pay an extra $100 for the phone than have ads all over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; We're developing a responsible access framework that makes models available to researchers for scholarly purposes while preventing misuse.&lt;p&gt;The idea of training such a model is really a great one, but not releasing it because someone might be offended by the output is just stupid beyond believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACR needs to die. It’s an absurd abuse of the privileged position that a TV has - a gross violation of privacy just to make a few bucks. It should be absolutely nobody’s business to know what you watch except your own; the motivation behind the VPPA was to kill exactly this type of abuse.&lt;p&gt;The greatest irony is that HDCP goes to great lengths to try and prevent people from screenshotting copyrighted content, and here we have the smart TVs at the end just scraping the content willy-nilly. If someone manages to figure out how to use ACR to break DRM, maybe the MPAA will be motivated to kill ACR :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Time-locked models don't roleplay; they embody their training data. Ranke-4B-1913 doesn't know about WWI because WWI hasn't happened in its textual universe. It can be surprised by your questions in ways modern LLMs cannot.”&lt;p&gt;“Modern LLMs suffer from hindsight contamination. GPT-5 knows how the story ends—WWI, the League's failure, the Spanish flu.”&lt;p&gt;This is really fascinating. As someone who reads a lot of history and historical fiction I think this is really intriguing. Imagine having a conversation with someone genuinely from the period, where they don’t know the “end of the story”.&lt;/p&gt;

If you click it, JavaScript runs on the discord.com origin.&lt;p&gt;Here's what could happen:&lt;p&gt;- Your Discord session cookies and token could be stolen, leading to a complete account takeover.&lt;p&gt;- read/write your developer applications &amp; webhooks, allowing them to add or modify bots, reset secrets, and push malicious updates to millions.&lt;p&gt;- access any Discord API endpoint as you, meaning they could join or delete servers, DM friends, or even buy Nitro with your saved payment info.&lt;p&gt;- maybe even harvest OAuth tokens from sites that use "Login with Disord."&lt;p&gt;Given the potential damage, the $4,000 bounty feels like a slap in the face.&lt;p&gt;edit: just noticed how HN just turned this into a clickable link - this makes it even scarier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to see it. They should have included Roku in that too!&lt;p&gt;&gt; Roughly twice per second, a Roku TV captures video “snapshots” in 4K resolution. These snapshots are scanned through a database of content and ads, which allows the exposure to be matched to what is airing. For example, if a streamer is watching an NFL football game and sees an ad for a hard seltzer, Roku’s ACR will know that the ad has appeared on the TV being watched at that time. In this way, the content on screen is automatically recognized, as the technology’s name indicates. The data then is paired with user profile data to link the account watching with the content they’re watching.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://advertising.roku.com/learn/resources/acr-the-future-of-tv-and-audience-data" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://advertising.roku.com/learn/resources/acr-the-future-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if my PS5 was doing the same thing when I'm playing a game or watching a streaming service through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the insanity of this idea. Not saying it's a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; idea, but it's a very highly entertaining one, and I like that!&lt;p&gt;I've also had enormous luck with Anubis. AI scrapers found my personal Forgejo server and were hitting it on the order of 600K requests per day. After setting up Anubis, that dropped to about 100. Yes, some people are going to see an anime catgirl from time to time. Bummer. Reducing my fake traffic by a factor of 6,000 is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels so emblematic of our current era. VC funded vibe coded AI documentation startup somehow gets big name customers who don't properly vet the security of the platform, ship a massive vulnerability that could pwn millions of users and the person who reports the vulnerability gets...$5k.&lt;p&gt;If I recall last week Mintlify wrote a blog post showcasing their impressive(ly complicated) caching architecture. Pretending like they were doing real engineering, when it turns out nobody there seems to know what they're doing, but they've managed to convince some big names to use them.&lt;p&gt;Man, it's like everything I hate about modern tech. Good job Eva for finding this one. Starting to think that every AI startup or company that is heavily using gen-ai for coding is probably extremely vulnerable to the simplest of attacks. Might be a way to make some extra spending money lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that SVG files can contain scripts was a bit of a mistake. On one hand, the animations and entire interactive demos and even games in a single SVG are cool. But on the other hand, it opens up a serious can of worms of security vulnerabilities. As a result, SVG files are often banned from various image upload tools, they do not unfurl previews, and so on. If you upload an SVG to discord, it just shows the raw code; and don't even think about sharing an SVG image via Facebook Messenger, Wechat, Google Hangouts, or whatever. In 2025, raster formats remain way more accessible and easily shared than SVGs.&lt;p&gt;This is very sad because SVGs often have way smaller file size, and obviously look much better at various scales. If only there was a widely used vector format that does not have any script support and can be easily shared.&lt;/p&gt;

Where Claude Code is good at "raw coding", Codex/GPT5.x are unbeatable in terms of careful, methodical finding of "problems" (be it in code, or in math).&lt;p&gt;Yes, it takes longer (quality, not speed please!) -- but the things that it finds consistently astound me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem is the incentives are off. Publishers are now rewarded for publishing more papers, as opposed to having more readers. When it was more readers, you were rewarded for the quality of the publication thus more people wanted to read it. By switching the profit incentive to number of publications, we have chosen quantity over quality.&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I prefer open access since those outside institutions can then read science, but the incentive model is heavily broken, and I'm not sure it's a good price to pay for the reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financials of open access are interesting.&lt;p&gt;Instead of journals getting revenue from subscribers, they charge authors an “Article Processing Charge” (APC) which for ACM is $1450 in 2026 and expected to go up. Authors from lower-middle income countries get a discount. [1]&lt;p&gt;Authors are often associated with institutions (e.g. universities) who can cover the APC on behalf of the author through a deal with the journal. For the institution, now instead of paying the subscriber fee and publishing for free, they pay a publishing fee and everyone reads for free.&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://authors.acm.org/open-access" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://authors.acm.org/open-access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm glad that got resolved for Paris, but what the hell is a normal person supposed to do. Not every one has that kind of public reach to get a satisfactory resolution.  First he had understand what happened technically, then he needed a public platform to tell people about it, then that writing needed to get reposted by others, than PR needed to get involved. Not something that's going to happen for a normal user.&lt;p&gt;Apple, Google, and the big players are not a trustworthy place to entrust precious data. Increasingly, Apple and Google aren't very much different as they are both in the advertisement business: the great misaligner of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will die on this hill, because I'm right. Painters put on the first layer in saturated colors like this, then add detail, highlight and shadow. The base layer stuck to the statues, and the rest was washed away.&lt;p&gt;This whole thing just won't go away because many people are operating outside their area of expertise on this subject.&lt;p&gt;Painters layer paint, starting with a saturated base color. These archaeologists are simply looking at the paint that was left in the crevices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; He warns that developers of apps like Signal and WhatsApp could technically fall within the legal definition of "hostile activity" simply because their technology "make[s] it more difficult for UK security and intelligence agencies to monitor communications.&lt;p&gt;Sounds like Let's Encrypt would also fall under that.&lt;p&gt;This has got to stop. If you want to stop criminals, then focus on their illegal activites, not the streets they walk on. I walk on them too. And don't use CP as a catch-all argument to insert backdoors.&lt;p&gt;Their big problem here is that previously, it was hard to find people with the same opinion as you. If you couldn't find someone in the same village who wanted to start a rebellion, it probably wouldn't happen. Today, someone can post a Telegram group message and make thousands of people rally to a town square. I see the dangers, and I see why governments think they are doing this to protect the people. No one wants civil war. That is still not a strong enough reason to call road construction a hostile activity.&lt;p&gt;I'm back in Sweden after 12 years abroad. Time to read up on which parties are sane and which aren't when it comes to technical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run a dead-simple, one-time, online fax service called JustFax Online[0].
While I don't have a recurring revenue as I operate one one-time payment, for the past months I have been consistently grossing over €500/mo.&lt;p&gt;This also brings tears to my eyes, as I remember[1] browsing these threads and being amazed (still am) by all the people who make side projects and make money from them, and at the same time thinking that I will never reach this milestone, and yet, here I am.&lt;p&gt;[0]: &lt;a href="https://justfaxonline.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://justfaxonline.com&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sometimes blows my mind how questions which essentially boil down to "How do I best manipulate you for personal gain?" can be asked in such an unabashed fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HN is hard to game on purpose. So stop looking for the levers and &lt;i&gt;participate&lt;/i&gt;, that's all there is to it. I've made friends here, have been helped by people on projects that I was busy with, did the reverse, found friends and business partners and spend way too much time. HN is a very interesting slice of the online world, a place that is unlike the rest, sometimes a bit dry but always interesting and &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; useful. If you're looking at it to try to understand it then you might as well try to understand a rat or a mouse. You won't understand it because it isn't there to be understood, it just is, like any other organism.&lt;p&gt;The root of HN is a thing called 'startup news', that was changed very quickly and since then HN has been a focal point for techies of all sorts but also lots of other people from all walks of life and from a large variety of countries. It isn't 'one thing' to everybody that participates, just like a hammer is a different thing for a carpenter than it is for a masoner or a farmer.&lt;p&gt;The fact that after being a member for a couple of years you have this question indicates a lack of participation, not a lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I'm a mod here)&lt;p&gt;It's true that this place can be cryptic, and that has downsides—specifically, it can be confusing to newcomers, even to some newcomers who would make ideal HN users. That sucks.&lt;p&gt;But there's a key that unlocks most of the puzzles. That is to understand that we're optimizing for exactly one thing: curiosity. (Specifically, intellectual curiosity, since there are other kinds of curiosity too.) Here are links to past explanations about that: &lt;a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;We try to elevate things that gratify curiosity: creative work, surprising discoveries, deep dives, technical achievements, unusual personal experience, whimsical unpredictability, good conversation, etc. And we try to demote things that run against curiosity, especially repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion.&lt;p&gt;It gets complicated because you'll also see plenty of repetition, indignation, sensationalism, and promotion on HN—alas! This is the internet after all. But the site survives because the balance of these things stays within tolerable ranges, thanks to two factors: an active community which cares greatly about preserving this place for intended purpose (&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html&lt;/a&gt;); and an owner (Y Combinator) that pays us to work on the site full time and mainly just wants us to keep it good, to the extent possible.&lt;p&gt;If you really want to figure this place out, the way to do it is as a &lt;i&gt;reader&lt;/i&gt;. Hang out on the site, look at the mix of articles that make the frontpage, spend time in the discussion threads (hopefully the interesting sectors and not the flamey ones!), and over time your eyes will adjust.&lt;p&gt;What doesn't work—and this is good because we want it not to work—is approaching HN as a platform for promoting content. If you (&lt;-- I don't mean you personally, but anyone) mainly care about "how can I use this thing to get attention for my startup/blog/project/newsletter", then you're operating in 'push' mode rather than 'pull' mode (or 'idle' mode, which is even better). In that case you won't be curious because you're too focused on what you're wanting for extraneous reasons—and if you aren't in a state of curiosity, this place won't make sense. At least we hope it won't!&lt;/p&gt;
