&lt;p&gt;Result first (kill anything not carbon-based), find rationale later.&lt;p&gt;Same applies to how this admin forced layoffs at the green energy (hydro + nuclear) behemoth BPA [1] (which was funded entirely by ratepayers, not the federal government) then claimed an energy emergency to keep open coal plants serving the same geographies, coal plants that were already uneconomical and planned for shut down (or re-tooling to gas in the case of TransAlta's plant in WA). [2] Oh and they already re-hired some of the laid off staff at BPA because they overcut.&lt;p&gt;There is no point in taking these arguments at face value. It's an excuse generated after-the-fact, and in service of one outcome - kill renewable energy.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2025/mar/12/letter-cuts-at-bpa-generate-questions/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.columbian.com/news/2025/mar/12/letter-cuts-at-bp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/doe-orders-wa-coal-plant-to-continue-operating-despite-state-ban/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/doe-or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the... It seems we crossed into the realm of intentionally doing damage.
I'm reminded of threatening tariffs to successfully derail global carbon levy on ship emissions.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile China runs away with all the clean energy tech (solar, wind, batteries, etc, etc.) while we hold to fossil fuels to save less than 200,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into this a little because I was curious. I guess the ostensible "national security" rationale (which clearly is not the only reason!) for this is that turbines severely degrade the utility of radar surveillance along the coastlines.&lt;p&gt;This is particularly relevant for low-altitude incursions and drones.&lt;p&gt;Now, other large governments (UK) have resolved this in several ways, including the deployment of additional radars on and within the turbine farms themselves.&lt;p&gt;So clearly this is politically motivated, and they're using what seems to be a real but solveable concern as a scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people I know who work in life sciences R&amp;D (basically anything bio) have had their funding absolutely annihilated. PhDs with 20 years of experience working second jobs as substitute high school teachers, lab workers taking up tech support positions paying a fraction of what was already terrible pay.&lt;p&gt;What's worse is that in &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; of these fields, you don't really even &lt;i&gt;start&lt;/i&gt; working until after your PhD.&lt;p&gt;4 years is going to be a long time to underfund what's basically 4 entire classes of researchers coming out of Doctorate programs. It might take decades to recover our research programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite lens on this comes from Hamming:&lt;p&gt;&gt; It is well known the drunken sailor whos taggers to the left or right n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about sqrt(n) steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance sqrt(n). In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.&lt;p&gt;Just a tiny bit of bias towards a direction will get you very far very fast.&lt;p&gt;I once modeled+visualised this with a bit of javascript[1] and it's quite surprising to see the huge difference from even a tiny multiplication factor on each random/probabilistic decision.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://swizec.com/blog/your-career-needs-a-vision/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://swizec.com/blog/your-career-needs-a-vision/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise is interesting but feels incomplete. The "Monday morning excitement test" doesn't account for the hedonic treadmill - even meaningful work becomes mundane once your brain adjusts to it.&lt;p&gt;Also, many people are genuinely burnt out from overwork, not just existential malaise. When you're juggling demanding work, family responsibilities, and barely have time for basic self-care, the problem isn't finding your "highest purpose" - it's structural.&lt;p&gt;That said, I agree that meaning matters. But meaning doesn't always come from work. Sometimes the healthiest thing is treating work as necessary fuel for a meaningful life outside of it - relationships, hobbies, community involvement.&lt;p&gt;The "go into politics" solution is fascinating though. Zero-sum games as existential fulfillment feels counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more people in this world willing to do their own thing, even if others might find it intimidating or silly. The important thing is to have fun and learn things. Compiler hacking is just as good as any other hobby, even if it's done in good jest.&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, these things become real businesses. Not that this should be the intent of this, but it shows that what some consider silly, others will pay good money for.&lt;p&gt;Example: Cards Against Humanity started as a bit of a gag game between a small group of friends and eventually became something that has pop culture relevance.&lt;p&gt;Example: The founder of FedEx actually wrote a business pitch paper for an overnight shipping company. This paper was given a low grade by his professor. He went on to form this company, which become a success, despite this low grade. I like to think that he did this out of spite, and that Christmas letters to his old professor must've been fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is cool, but it will almost definitely never end up in a park, outside of some promotional situations.&lt;p&gt;Disney's been doing awesome work with "Living Characters", like a Mickey that moves his mouth or a BB-8 that can roll around. But for various reasons, they never tend to make it into regular usage.&lt;p&gt;If you have a few hours over Christmas break and want to watch a 4 hour YouTube video (I promise if you're on HN on a Sunday, you'll be delighted by it), I highly highly recommend this video:&lt;p&gt;"Disney's Living Characters: A Broken Promise" by Defunctland

&lt;p&gt;Easy answer to your last point: Work machine and Non-work machine. If I'm working for a company and the company needs MS Office, they will give me a machine with MS Office. I will treat that machine like a radioactive zone. Full Hazmat suit. Not a shred of personal interaction with that machine. It exists only to do work on and that's that. The company can take care of keeping it up to date, and the company's IT department can do the bending over the table on my behest as MS approaches with dildos marked "Copilot" or "Recall" or "Cortana" or "React Native Start Menu" or "OneDrive" or whatever.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my personal machine continues to be Linux.&lt;p&gt;This is what I'm doing at my work now. I'm lucky enough to have two computers, a desktop PC that runs Linux, and a laptop with Windows 11. I do not use that laptop unless I have to deal with xlsx, pptx or docx files. Life is so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the days when personal computers were simply tools, akin to pencils and handheld calculators.  I remember the days of Macintosh System 7 and Windows 95.  No upselling services.  No automatic updates.  No nagging.  You turned your computer on, executed programs, and that was it.&lt;p&gt;On the Windows side, things started going downhill starting with the Windows XP era, and on the Mac the annoyances began sometime in the mid-2010s.&lt;p&gt;It seems Microsoft, Apple, and other companies realized that they’re leaving money on the table by not exploiting their platforms.  Thus, they’re no longer selling simple tools, but rather they are selling us services.&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are good Linux distributions that don’t annoy me, and the BSDs never nag me, but the problem with switching to these platforms is that I still need Microsoft Office and other proprietary software tools that are not available outside “Big Tech.”  There are other matters that make switching away from Windows and macOS challenging, such as hardware support and laptop battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone want to buy a new computer now unless the old one is worn out?
There is no price/performance improvement. Nor will there be for the next five years or so. NVidia says to expect 10% price increases each year. DRAM prices have doubled, and Samsung says not to expect price cuts. Micron just exited the retail RAM business.&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to escape this trap by pivoting to Windows as a subscription service. It will get worse, not better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm burned out because I have to raise two young children, work a full time job in a demanding career, and then in the hour or two a day of time that isn't accounted for in those two tasks, I need to maintain a household and try to care for myself. I feel a strong sense of purpose caring for my family, but don't have enough time to meet life's demands. Maybe other people relate more to this post because they more money and no kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A post on this topic feels incomplete without a shout-out to Charity Majors - she has been preaching this for a decade, branded the term "wide events" and "observability", and built honeycomb.io around this concept.&lt;p&gt;Also worth pointing out that you can implement this method with a lot of tools these days. Both structured Logs or Traces lend itself to capture wide events. Just make sure to use a tool that supports general query patterns and has rich visualizations (time-series, histograms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was living in Paris I had a 20 min ride from home to work each day.

One easily underestimates the power of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with Tim Ferriss, you should know that there is always more to the story than the narrative he shares. He’s one of the most charismatic and charming writers and podcasters out there and has a strong ability to build trust through his writing. However, he also has a long history of stretching the truth and spinning history in his favor, often by omitting important facts.&lt;p&gt;One example: His 4 Hour Work Week book really was on the New York Times Best Seller list for a long time like he brags about in this post, but he has also bragged in other contexts about all of the manipulation and engineering (including mass purchasing books to artificially inflate sales numbers) that goes into gaming the New York Times Best Seller List.&lt;p&gt;On the topic of being famous, he’s not typically famous like a celebrity. He built his career around being a self-help guru who will bring you the secrets to success in business, life, relationships, and even cooking. He’s talked about how he selects his writing topics based on how to present solutions for people’s inner desires, like financial freedom or impressing people for dating success. He puts himself at the center of these writings, presenting himself as the conduit for these revelations. He was even early in social media and blogging and experimented with social media engagements and paid events where you get to come hang out with Tim Ferriss and learn his secrets, encouraging his fans to idolize him and his wisdom dispensing abilities.&lt;p&gt;So his relationship with his fans isn’t typical fame in the style of a celebrity or actor. He’s more of an early self-help guru who embraced social media and blogging early on. His experience with uncomfortable fan obsessions is therefore probably on the next level, but not exactly typical fame.&lt;p&gt;EDIT to add why I know this: Tim Ferriss literally wrote the book on how to abuse remote work. His Four Hour Work Week book encourages readers to talk their boss into working remote then to outsource their work to low paid overseas assistants so they have more time to travel the world. It encourages things like setting up an e-mail auto responder and only responding to your coworkers once a week whine you’re “working remote” and setting up your own side job while traveling the world. If you’ve ever had a remote work job get ruined by people abusing it, chances are good that those people had read a Tim Ferriss book somewhere along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used cursor over the past three weeks to update a 12 year-old Ruby on rails project. While it has been slightly updated throughout the years, this was my first proper modernization of the code base.&lt;p&gt;It’s been a real pleasure getting back into Ruby after so many years in typescript, python, and rust.&lt;p&gt;Happy to see the update. Real shame about the haters here, the Ruby community is a supportive and positive bunch that has shipped real products while others seem to worship at the altar of computer science alone… that’s about as counter snarky as I want to be here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many Web designers put zero thought into how their page looks when it is not loaded or not scrolled exactly past the trigger. So many sites say "0 happy customers", because someone thought showing incrementing numbers is cool. On this page, it opens up with a "100%" loading indicator, for a site that appears to have no interactivity that would require JS, just to show a pointless animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s incredibly harsh. A blanket ban on AI generated assets is dumb as hell. Generating placeholder assets is completely acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI witch hunt claims its first victim, apparently over some placeholder textures.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt; Sandfall Interactive further clarifies that there are no generative AI-created assets in the game. When the first AI tools became available in 2022, some members of the team briefly experimented with them to generate temporary placeholder textures. Upon release, instances of a placeholder texture were removed within 5 days to be replaced with the correct textures that had always been intended for release, but were missed during the Quality Assurance process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Claude seems to have access to a tool to evaluate JS on the webpage, using the Chrome debugger.&lt;p&gt;However, don't worry about the security of this! There is a comprehensive set of regexes to prevent secrets from being exfiltrated.&lt;p&gt;const r = [/password/i, /token/i, /secret/i, /api[_-]?key/i, /auth/i, /credential/i, /private[_-]?key/i, /access[_-]?key/i, /bearer/i, /oauth/i, /session/i];&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hn-wrapped.kadoa.com/ethmarks" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://hn-wrapped.kadoa.com/ethmarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mine seems to think that I'm some kind of detail-obsessed super-pedant. Personally, I think this is ridiculous. "super" is a Latin stem meaning "beyond", which implies that I've transcended the qualities of pedantry. A better term would be 'pluri-pedant', which denotes someone who is exceptionally punctilious while still remaining within the bounds of being pedantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Flock truly believed that the domain name infringes on their trademark, they would file an ICANN UDRP complaint instead of Cloudflare and Hetzner abuse reports.&lt;p&gt;But they don't, because the former would require them to perjure themselves, and the latter just requires them to lie to a hosting company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's spend years plugging holes in V8, splitting browser components to separate processes and improving sandboxing and then just plug in LLM with debugging enabled into Chrome. Great idea. Last time we had such a great idea it was lead in gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm impressed. You guys cloned a whole suite of products in a short period of time that cost millions of dollars. Even the little bits of humor look costly.&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it's way more information than I expected. I can see why someone would hesitate to release them - there's a lot to sift through and it's likely even the government couldn't sift through all of them to make sure their friends weren't mentioned somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
