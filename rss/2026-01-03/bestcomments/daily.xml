&lt;p&gt;I would like to add:&lt;p&gt;- HPVs are extremely common: 80% of men and 90% of women will have at least one strain in their lives. Unless you plan to remain completely celibate, you are likely to contract a strain.&lt;p&gt;- Sooner is better, but vaccination can be done at any age. Guidelines often lag behind, but vaccination makes sense even if you are currently HPV-positive. While it won't clear an existing infection, it protects against different strains and reinfection (typically body removed HPV in 1-2 years). See: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38137661/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38137661/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;- HPV16 is responsible for a large number of throat cancers (around 50% in smokers and 80% in non-smokers!). This affects both men and women. Vaccinating men is important for their own safety and to reduce transmission to their partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believability aside (I do think it’s believable personally) this is pretty much how “evil” (from outsider perspective) is done at every company, including mine. Inside it’s all sprint meetings, KPIs and terminology that are either intentionally or unintentionally designed to keep engineers far from thinking about impact on real people. It’s easy to convince a 25 year old whiz kid to optimize human assets, it’s just like Factorio and it feels good to see the number go up. In-jokes and dark humor fly and it all feels not real and just like a game. Sometimes on purpose by management, sometimes automatic as a coping mechanism. Defense (my field) is very much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is an active discussion where we're trying to get to a point of clarity where we can promote to an issue (when it is actionable). The discussion is open and this is the system working as intended!&lt;p&gt;I want to clarify though that there isn't a known widespread "memory leak issue." You didn't say "widespread", but just in case that is taken by anyone else. :) To clarify, there are a few challenges here:&lt;p&gt;1. The report at hand seems to affect a very limited number of users (given the lack of reports and information about them). There are lots of X meme posts about Ghostty in the macOS "Force Close" window using a massive amount of RAM but that isn't directly useful because that window also reports all the RAM _child processes_ are using (e.g. if you run a command in your shell that consumes 100 GB of RAM, macOS reports it as Ghostty using 100 GB of RAM). And the window by itself also doesn't tell us what you were doing in Ghostty. It farms good engagement, though.&lt;p&gt;2. We've run Ghostty on Linux under Valgrind in a variety of configurations (the full GUI), we run all of Ghostty's unit tests under Valgrind in CI for every commit, and we've run Ghostty on macOS with the Xcode Instruments leak checker in a variety of configurations and we haven't yet been able to find any leaks. Both of these run fully clean. So, the "easy" tools can't find it.&lt;p&gt;3. Following point 1 and 2, no maintainer familiar with the codebase has ever seen leaky behavior. Some of us run a build of Ghostty, working full time in a terminal, for weeks, and memory is stable.&lt;p&gt;4. Our Discord has ~30K users, and within it, we only have one active user who periodically gets a large memory issue. They haven't been able to narrow this down to any specific reproduction and they aren't familiar enough with the codebase to debug it themselves, unfortunately. They're trying!&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I 100% believe that there is some kind of leak affecting some specific configuration of users. That's why the discussion is open and we're soliciting input. I even spent about an hour today on the latest feedback (posted earlier today) trying to use that information to narrow it down. No dice, yet.&lt;p&gt;If anyone has more info, we'd love to find this. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; I’m posting this from a library Wi-Fi on a burner laptop because I am technically under a massive NDA. I don’t care anymore. I put in my two weeks yesterday and honestly, I hope they sue me.&lt;p&gt;Why bother using library Wi-Fi on a burner laptop if he doesn't care anymore? Why give out the biggest clue, which is the time of his resignation letter? 
If the story is real, this company is a straight-up scammer waiting for the biggest headline and lawsuit of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100% agree.&lt;p&gt;If it's someone else's project, they have full authority to decide what is and isn't an issue. With large enough projects, you're going to have enough bad actors, people who don't read error messages, and just downright crazy people. Throw in people using AI for dubious purposes like CVE inflation, and it's even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I oversee pressing for over 150k+ records a year. We eliminated download cards a while ago because the redemption rate was so low. I wouldn’t doubt if the number of buyers who don’t own a record player is even higher tha 50%, and that the percentage of people who actually play the records is actually 10-20%. I don’t have data on that, it’s just a hunch.&lt;p&gt;Many of us in the indie music industry (hip hop sustained record plants for many years, arguably until independent music started pressing in the 2000s) have mixed feelings about records. It’s a lot of plastic. A lot of waste. And they’re cubersome to bring on tour.&lt;p&gt;But there isn’t another physical medium that sells at all as well as vinyl. Soft apparel always does well. But people want vinyl.&lt;p&gt;I don’t love the Gen Z framing of this though. Vinyl purchasing at this point is multi generational.&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s some mysterious Gen Z love of physical. I think we all know that Spotify doesn’t pay artists appropriately and we want to help sustain the music we love. Buying digitally is just isn’t the same for a lot of people (even though it arguably is the best and easiest income generator for artists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read your comment before visiting the site, and it got me wondering -- how bad can it be? Can it be worse than those acid green on red sites of the 90s-00s?&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise, when I opened the site and it looked and felt just like a museum or art exhibit. This was the literal feeling I had -- being at an art gallery, but online.&lt;p&gt;I guess, these comments tell more about the commenters, than TFA. We should remind ourselves to be more critical to the content we consume, regardless where it comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto manufacturing is low margin and capital intensive. BYD is valued as an auto manufacturer. Tesla is not.&lt;p&gt;Even all of that aside, the idea that foreign investors will be allowed to meaningfully participate in the upside of Chinese companies is questionable. Every Chinese company is one recapitalization away from zeroing out the common stock owned by foreigners. What are they gonna do, sue in Chinese court?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These games are all rated gold or platinum on protondb, indicating that they work perfectly for &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; people.&lt;p&gt;Hard to say what might be going wrong for you without more details. I would guess there's something wrong with your video driver. Maybe you have an nvidia card and the OS has installed the nouveau drivers by default? Installing the nvidia first-party drivers (downloaded from the nvidia web site) will fix a lot of things. This is indeed a sore spot for Linux gaming, though to be fair graphics driver problems are not exactly unheard of on Windows either.&lt;p&gt;Personally I have a bunch of machines dedicated to gaming in my house (&lt;a href="https://lanparty.house" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://lanparty.house&lt;/a&gt;) which have proven to be much more stable running Linux than they were with Windows. I think this is because the particular NIC in these machines just has terrible Windows drivers, but decent Linux drivers (and I am netbooting, so network driver stability is pretty critical to the whole system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched all the machines at &lt;a href="https://lanparty.house" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://lanparty.house&lt;/a&gt; over to Linux a couple months ago. So far, we've experienced noticeably &lt;i&gt;fewer&lt;/i&gt; problems on Linux compared to Windows. Stability and performance are better. I can't think of one game we tried that didn't work. And wow is it nice not to have all the ads and crapware in our faces anymore.&lt;p&gt;(I'm aware that Battlefield series and League of Legends won't work due to draconian anti-cheat -- but nobody in my group cares to play those I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; a significant proportion of the people you used to hang out with have kids and disappear off the face of the Earth for two decades.&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on both sides of this, so I’m going to put this out into the universe:&lt;p&gt;Your friends with kids still want to see you.&lt;p&gt;They have a lot to deal with suddenly. They’re exhausted.&lt;p&gt;But they miss hanging out with you, and will leap at the opportunity to hang out if you take the initiative and make some kid-friendly accommodations.&lt;p&gt;They may decline more often than before, because the kid is sick or sleeping or not sleeping so the adults just need to lay low. But don’t take that “no” as a “stop asking”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the comments here are a great example of why this idea always sounds better in nostalgic reminiscence than in practice: As I write this, nearly half of the comments here are &lt;i&gt;complaining&lt;/i&gt; about this website. There are complaints about requiring JavaScript, the font size, the design, the color choices, the animations. Complaints about everything the designer did to make this site unique and personal, which was the entire point of the exercise. This is coming from a site that supposedly attracts the target audience for this type of page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that this area where the incident happened, Gulf of Finland, is not fully part Finnish/Estonian territorial waters, is only because of a bilateral Finnish-Estonian agreement. This was done in the 1990's purely for benevolence towards Russia.&lt;p&gt;Russia clearly hasn't acted in such way that they should enjoy these kinds of acts of benevolence. Finland and Estonia should seriously consider retreating from this agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think its interesting that mainstream PC gaming press is now talking about Linux. We have the benchmark Youtube channels doing some benchmarks of it as well and plenty of reports of "it just works", which is pretty promising at least for the games that aren't intentionally excluded by DRM. For me its still controllers and equipment incompatibility due to my VR headset and sim wheel/pedals setup, I use Linux everywhere else in my router and home servers. I just hope that Nvidia notices that there does appear to be a swing happening and improves their driver situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people here are commenting that if you have to care about specific latency numbers in Python you should just use another language.&lt;p&gt;I disagree. A lot of important and large codebases were grown and maintained in Python (Instagram, Dropbox, OpenAI) and it's damn useful to know how to reason your way out of a Python performance problem when you inevitably hit one &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; dropping out into another language, which is going to be far more complex.&lt;p&gt;Python is a very useful tool, and knowing these numbers just makes you better at using the tool.
The author is a &lt;i&gt;Python Software Foundation Fellow&lt;/i&gt;. They're great at using the tool.&lt;p&gt;In the common case, a performance problem in Python is not the result of hitting the limit of the language but the result of sloppy un-performant code, for example unnecessarily calling a function O(10_000) times in a hot loop.&lt;p&gt;I wrote up a more focused "Python latency numbers you should know" as a quiz here &lt;a href="https://thundergolfer.com/computers-are-fast" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://thundergolfer.com/computers-are-fast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad grew up in the 50s &amp; 60s. During COVID he purchased my daughters' the, I quote, "shittiest briefcase record players" he could find. Both girls listen to their music on their devices, but also buy vinyl. The other day, my eldest came down from her room complaining that her vinyl "sounded awful". I told her to bring it up with their Grampy. His response: "you can't appreciate good playback until you've heard awful playback on shitty record players &lt;i&gt;like I had to&lt;/i&gt;.". My eldest is now plotting a complete hifi system, and is learning all about how to transfer "vinyl" to "digital" without losing the parts of the vinyl she &lt;i&gt;likes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;This was a 5 year play by my dad. Shout out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, got to go to Hong Kong for a couple months for work and got to bring my family.&lt;p&gt;I was about to turn 40 and realized that the place we were staying had a rock wall. In a somewhat "mid life crisis" spur of the moment decision, I decided to go buy shoes, a belt and a chalk bag (I did a lot of indoor rock climbing in college).&lt;p&gt;We get there and the rock wall is a. closed and b. only for kids.&lt;p&gt;Get back to the US and COVID lockdown starts. As things open up, I go on the town dad's Facebook group and ask if anyone wants to go rock climbing with me. Multiple dads say "hell, yes!" so I start a rock climbing club.&lt;p&gt;One of the dads that joins the climbing club loves board games, is inspired by my starting the rock climbing club so he starts the town board game club.&lt;p&gt;I tell people this story to illustrate that:&lt;p&gt;- if you don't have a club or org for something that you're into, go start one&lt;p&gt;- you doing the above can trigger other people to start clubs too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad this submission is finally receiving upvotes.&lt;p&gt;This was just shown at the 39C3 in Hamburg, few days back.&lt;p&gt;Common (unpached) Bluetooth headsets using Airoha's SoCs can be completely taken over by any unauthenticated bystander with a Linux laptop. (CVE-2025-20700, CVE-2025-20701, CVE-2025-20702)&lt;p&gt;This includes firmware dumps, user preferences, Bluetooth Classic session keys, current playing track, ...&lt;p&gt;&gt; Examples of affected vendors and devices are Sony (e.g., WH1000-XM5, WH1000-XM6, WF-1000XM5), Marshall (e.g. Major V, Minor IV), Beyerdynamic (e.g. AMIRON 300), or Jabra (e.g. Elite 8 Active).&lt;p&gt;Most vendors gave the security researchers either silent treatment or were slow, even after Airoha published fixes. Jabra was one of the positive outlier, Sony unfortunately negatively.&lt;p&gt;What is exciting, even though the flaws are awful, that it is unlikely for current generation of those Airoha bluetooth headsets to change away from Aiorha's Bluetooth LE "RACE" protocol. This means there is great opportunity for Linux users to control their Bluetooth headsets, which for example is quite nice in an office setting to toggle "hearthrough" when toggling volume "mute" on your machine.&lt;p&gt;RACE Reverse Engineered - CLI Tool: &lt;a href="https://github.com/auracast-research/race-toolkit" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/auracast-research/race-toolkit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like this should receive state-level attention, the remote audio surveillance of any headset can be a major threat. I wonder what the policies in countries official buildings are when it comes to Bluetooth audio devices, considering that Jabra is a major brand for conference speakers, I'd assume some actual espionage threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should never idolize a person (in my opinion). Here are some things Buffet has done that I admire (notice that phrasing):&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  - He consistently communicated with shareholders of Berkshire in a straight-forward and transparent way in his letters and annual reports. If you read these documents, I believe that you will have a solid understanding of how he built Berkshire.
  - He maintained a disciplined approach to investing and managing risk over 60+ years.
  - He still lives in the same home he bought when he was 28 years old.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Our society has become moralistic. It's so much more useful to identify behaviors to learn from - either to emulate or to avoid - than to debate whether various public figures are good or bad people.&lt;p&gt;That said, it makes me a little sad that we've read the last of his annual letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Healthy, recreationally active but untrained young males&lt;p&gt;Yeah this is why. Anything you do as an untrained person is going to get you newbie gains. It's just really easy to improve initially. Doesn't mean it'll work after the first 6 months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd have thought it wouldn't be the proteins in the input, but the prions in the output they would care about.  They're remarkably resilient, it's not unreasonable to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving 7 minutes to work and stopping at a drive-thru to pick up McDonalds breakfast every day. The man is a true American hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the positive encourage here and in my email, I've decided to go the self-publishing route. I setup a pre-order page and will release each chapter as I go. :)&lt;p&gt;Happy New Years, HN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm often so flustered to be interrupted by yet-another-marketing-modal that I will just close the tab and abandon whatever task, or purchase, I was undertaking. They are actively harmful to my holistic state-of-mind and make me into a more agitated and cynical user of the web.&lt;p&gt;Who are the people who decided this is how 90% of web pages should act, and how did they win? Do so many people really sign up for newsletters when prompted?&lt;/p&gt;
