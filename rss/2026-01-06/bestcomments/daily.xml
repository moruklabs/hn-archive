&lt;p&gt;The number of people saying that it is not worthy of intervention that every single woman who posts on twitter has to worry about somebody saying "hey grok, take her clothes off" and then be made into a public sex object is maybe the most acute example of rape culture that I've seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking on extra responsibility is all well and good until someone figures out that they can just get you to do more work for the same amount of money. At that point your only option is to move on, because if you stop performing at the "expected" level due to lack of reciprocation, suddenly you have "performance issues".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We maintain a single VS Code setting that allows you to opt out of the AI features provided in VS Code: "chat.disableAIFeatures" (see also: &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_104#_hide-and-disable-github-copilot-ai-features" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_104#_hide-and-disab...&lt;/a&gt;). If you can still find AI features appearing after you have configured this setting, then please report an issue at &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/vscode&lt;/a&gt; and we are happy to take a look.&lt;p&gt;It is possible that from time to time a new AI related feature slips in that does not respect that setting, but we try our best to push fixes as soon as possible.&lt;p&gt;Thanks!

&lt;p&gt;&gt; If a PM tells you to shove a UI style&lt;p&gt;More than likely designers are making up work to justify their jobs. Not good for your career if you admit the desktop interface was perfected in ~1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments I keep seeing from people churning out AI video is that the tech is enabling people "creative freedom" that's been made possible now even without the technical know how.&lt;p&gt;However, 99% of the the "creativity" from what I've seen is done by the AI (how it should look, where the cuts need to happen, the tone, color grading, etc). Which is to say, it's taken from other people's (creative) work.&lt;p&gt;While a big part of being able to create a good video has much to do with storytelling, the craft of shooting and editing a video is a big part of the creative process as well.&lt;p&gt;AI video isn't "enabling people to be more creative," it is quite literally removing creativity from the process all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many underlying changes to the established relationship between Labor and Capital in the US that would be a necessary part of keeping jobs here that it would effectively make us a completely different country.&lt;p&gt;For example -- suppose one could snap one's fingers and "bring back" millions of manufacturing jobs. What would lead one to conclude those would be the kind of "good jobs" everyone is envisioning? Historically, they were better jobs due to a strong labor movement, but that movement has been largely destroyed.&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if we want widespread prosperity, there is no reason service jobs should not be "good jobs." There is no economic rule that says that riveting should pay more than taking care of the elderly or food delivery.&lt;p&gt;We have jobs, we have just decided that the people working those jobs are not deserving of prosperity. If we re-shore jobs, what would make anyone think we would treat those jobs differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to justify Liquid Glass in general. The wastefulness of flat design (in terms of space) married with the visual excess of skeuomorphism, but without even providing any affordances (does the sidebar being raised give you any new information on how to use a sidebar? No).&lt;p&gt;If you're a designer at a top 10 S&amp;P 500 company making 6 figures, you owe it to yourself to have some love for your craft. If a PM tells you to shove a UI style meant for an unsuccessful VR device onto desktop and mobile platforms, say no. Get your colleagues to say no. Make that PM read everything the Nielsen Norman group has ever written. Read it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent article.&lt;p&gt;Apple has been rudderless on the interaction design front for over a decade now. The windowing mess is evidence of it. We now have the cmd+tab (app switcher), Spaces, Mission Control, (full screen) split screen,  Stage Manager, and now tiled window control. None of those interaction metaphors have been expanded upon since their initial launch.&lt;p&gt;I'm a "mac guy". I understood why Apple initially eschewed windows style alt-tab, given the emphasis on app-centricism. But now, they've created a thousand different ways to switch windows without giving us a proper window switcher. There are apps that bring alt-tab to Mac, but they are all bad because Apple doesn't give developers access to the low-level APIs to create performant and fully featured window management.&lt;p&gt;Before, Apple had an endless well of great ideas to tap. That's how we got the term "Sherlocked".  However, now that they've locked down macOS so much, they've suffocated themselves of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tahoe and Liquid Glass™ solidified for me the idea that Apple completely dropped the ball when it comes to design. Clearly they needed an a-hole in charge, Jobs would've crucified a few people.&lt;p&gt;It's painful to see the decay, update after update, into a more confusing, cluttered, and tacky experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't the only aspect of Tahoe that seems amateurishly designed by someone following "wrong rules", the wrong rule here being "for consistency, let's assign an icon to every action.&lt;p&gt;Another wrong rules I've seen blindly followed is making everything an edge-to-edge canvas, so that the sidebar floats on top. Having a full-window canvas with floating sidebars can make sense for applications where content is expansive and inherently spatial (like say, Figma) or applications where the sidebar is an actual floating element that can be moved around (like Photoshop once was).&lt;p&gt;It doesn't make sense in Finder, or Reminders, where the content is ultimately just a list. Forcing the sidebar "to float on top of the content" yields no benefit because the content wont ever scroll under it, and because it can't be moved anyway, but it does lead to wasted space, that ugly "double border", etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely thought this was a joke when I saw the headline, and I had to double check the domain name to verify that this wasn't a parody.&lt;p&gt;Apart from being absolutely abysmal marketing, the front page alone is wildly inconsistent:&lt;p&gt;* "Welcome to Microsoft 365 Copilot"&lt;p&gt;* "The Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office) [...]"&lt;p&gt;* "Microsoft 365 (formerly Microsoft Office 365) is a subscription service [...]"&lt;p&gt;Which is it, "Microsoft 365 Copilot", "(The) Microsoft 365 Copilot app", "(The) Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)", "Microsoft 365" or "Microsoft 365 (formerly Microsoft Office 365)"?&lt;p&gt;I think Microsoft delegated all marketing decisions to AI. Not even joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know but to me this all sounds like the antithesis of what makes programming fun. You don't have productivity goals for hobby coding where you'd have to make the most of your half an hour -- that sounds too much like paid work to be fun. If you have a half an hour, you tinker for a half an hour and enjoy it. Then you continue when you have another half an hour again. (Or push into night because you can't make yourself stop.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; If the Google culture was at all obsessed about helping users, I wonder why Google UX always sucked so much and in particularly in the recent years seem to be getting even worse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no beancounter takeover and it never was so obsessed. I worked there from 2006-2014 in engineering roles and found this statement was particularly jarring: &lt;i&gt;"User obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I worked on user facing stuff (Maps, Gmail, Accounts) I regularly read the public user support forums and ticket queues looking for complaints, sometimes I even took part in user threads to get more information. What I learned was:&lt;p&gt;• Almost nobody else in engineering did this.&lt;p&gt;• I was considered weird for doing it.&lt;p&gt;• It was viewed negatively by managers and promo committees.&lt;p&gt;• An engineer talking directly to users was considered especially weird and problematic.&lt;p&gt;• The products did always have serious bugs that had escaped QA and monitoring.&lt;p&gt;In theory there were staff paid to monitor these forums, but in practice the eng managers paid little attention to them - think "user voice" reports once a quarter, that sort of thing. Partly that's because they weren't technical and often struggled to work out whether a user complaint was just noise or due to a genuine bug in the product, something often obvious to an engineer, so stuff didn't get escalated properly.&lt;p&gt;This general disconnection from the outside world was pervasive. When I joined the abuse team in 2010 I was surprised to discover that despite it having existed for many years, only one engineer was bothering to read spammer forums where they talked to each other, and he was also brand new to the team. He gave me his logins and we quickly discovered spammers had found bugs in the accounts web servers they were using to blow past the antispam controls, without this being visible from any monitoring on our side. We learned many other useful things by doing this kind of "abuser research". But it was, again, very unusual. The team until that point had been dominated by ML-heads who just wanted to use it as a testing ground for model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a former contractor and current hirer of contractors, I wish I understood this more when I was on the other side.&lt;p&gt;This story is an outlier (10x!) and probably should have involved more communication, but the ultimate lesson checks out.&lt;p&gt;I used to be so embarrassed to send my invoice or charge more as scope increased. If something went unpaid, I'd rather eat the cost than reach out with a reminder. Turns out it's more likely someone didn't think about it or forgot than any sort of malice.&lt;p&gt;As a contractor, you think of money in terms of actual dollars – rent, food, etc. When you're paying the invoice, you think of it as a resource used to get either get results or get your own time back.&lt;p&gt;It's not that companies don't care about money (they do, a lot), but the math is much different on their end. Money can feel like an equalizer (it's how we serialize time, resources, etc into a common way to transact), but if you're a contractor, you can make way more if you understand the perspective of the person paying you.&lt;p&gt;For example, proactive communication and hitting deadlines is much more important than saving costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not looking to dismiss the authors long tenure at a major tech company like Google, but the first point kind of stuck like a sore thumb. If the Google culture was at all obsessed about helping users, I wonder why Google UX always sucked so much and in particularly in the recent years seem to be getting even worse. Every single one of their services is a pain to use, with unnecessary steps, clicks - basically everything you are trying to do needs a click of sorts. Recently I was writing an e-mail and noticed I misspelled the e-mail address of the recipient, which I rarely do. So, I should just be able to click the address and edit it quickly, right? Wrong - now you have a popup menu and inside of it you have to search for "edit e-mail" option. Most of the rest of his lessons while valuable in  their own right, are not  something I would put under the headline of "after X years at &lt;insert-major-tech-company&gt;", as they do not quite seem to be  that different from lessons you pick up at other companies ? I´d more interested to hear about how the culture was impacted when the bean-counters took over and started entshittifying the company for both the users and the employees too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many negative comments here.

That changed how I think about distractions. If I had written about it, there surely will be people who would just like here say... &lt;i&gt;What is so crazy about it? I do that all the time...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, this post is someone's joy and curiosity shared through a well written piece. Everybody discover certain things at different stages of their lives.

&lt;p&gt;&gt; At scale, even your bugs have users.&lt;p&gt;First place I worked right out of college had a big training seminar for new hires. One day we were told the story of how they’d improved load times from around 5min to 30seconds, this improvement was in the mid 90s. The negative responses from clients were instant. The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee the software was ready before they’d even stood up from their desk!&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story, and the quote, isn’t that you shouldn’t improve things. Instead it’s a reminder that the software you’re building doesn’t exist in a PRD or a test suite. It’s a system that people will interact with out there in the world. Habits with form, workarounds will be developed, bugs will be leaned for actual use cases.&lt;p&gt;This makes it critically important that you, the software engineer, understand the purpose and real world usage of your software. Your job isn’t to complete tickets that fulfill a list of asks from your product manager. Your job is to build software that solves users problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first learned about the "innovation tokens" idea in "Novelty is a loan you repay in outages, hiring, and cognitive overhead" from this, still one of my favorite essays on software architecture: &lt;a href="https://boringtechnology.club/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://boringtechnology.club/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, "Abstractions don’t remove complexity. They move it to the day you’re on call." made me think of this 23 year old classic from Joel Spolsky, the Law of Leaky Abstractions: &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I like about our weird new LLM-assisted world is the number of people I know who are coding again, having mostly stopped as they moved into management roles or lost their personal side project time to becoming parents.&lt;p&gt;AI assistance means you can get something useful done in half an hour, or even &lt;i&gt;while&lt;/i&gt; you are doing other stuff. You don't need to carve out 2-4 hours to ramp up any more.&lt;p&gt;If you have significant previous coding experience - even if it's a few years stale - you can drive these things extremely effectively. Especially if you have management experience, quite a lot of which transfers to "managing" coding agents (communicate clearly, set achievable goals, provide all relevant context.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "what" vs "why" distinction breaks down when your code encodes domain knowledge that readers can't infer from context.&lt;p&gt;I build accounting software and half my "what" comments are actually explaining business rules that would be impenetrable otherwise. Something like:&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  // Bank transfers appear as two transactions - a debit here and credit elsewhere
  // We match them by looking for equal-opposite amounts within a 3-day window
  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
That's explaining "what" but also implicitly "why" - because that's how double-entry works and that's the tolerance banks allow for settlement delays. You can't really extract that into a method name without it becoming absurd.&lt;p&gt;The Uncle Bob approach of extractNameMatchingTransfersWithinSettlementWindow() doesn't actually help - now I need to know what settlement windows are anyway, and I've lost the context of why 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning.&lt;p&gt;I was an early SO user and I don’t agree with this.&lt;p&gt;The moderation was always there, but from my perspective it wasn’t until the site really pushed into branching out and expanding Stack Exchange across many topics to become a Quora style competitor that the moderation started taking on a life of its own. Stack Overflow moderator drama felt constant in the later 2010s with endless weird drama spilling across Twitter, Reddit, and the moderator’s personal blogs. That’s about the same time period where it felt like the moderation team was more interested in finding reasons to exercise their moderation power than in maintaining an interesting website.&lt;p&gt;Since about 2020 every time I click a Stack Overflow link I estimate there’s a 50/50 chance that the question I clicked on would be marked as off topic or closed or something before anyone could answer it. Between the moderator drama and the constant bait-and-switch feeling of clicking on SO links that didn’t go anywhere the site just felt more exhausting than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; The fundamental value proposition of SO is getting an answer to a question&lt;p&gt;I read an interview once with one of the founders of SO. They said the main value stackoverflow provided wasn't to the person who asked the question. It was for the person who googled it later and found the answer. This is why all the moderation pushes toward deleting duplicates of questions, and having a single accepted answer. They were primarily trying to make google searches more effective for the broader internet. Not provide a service for the question-asker or answerer.&lt;p&gt;Sad now though, since LLMs have eaten this pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various admonitions to publish to a personal blog, while encouraging, don't really get at the 0xfaded's request which I'd summarize as follows:&lt;p&gt;With no one asking questions these technical questions publicly, where, how and on what public platform will technical people find the problems that need solving so they can exercise their creativity for the benefit of all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Because I don’t write a daily blog to crank out a post every day. If that was the point, I’d have switched to AI long ago already. I write a daily blog to make sure I remember how to think.&lt;p&gt;I feel like this will get missed by the general public. What’s the point in generating writing or generating art if it gives next to zero feelings of accomplishment?&lt;p&gt;I could generate some weird 70s sci fi art, make an Instagram profile around that, barrage the algorithm with my posts and rack up likes. The likes will give that instant dopamine but it will never fill that need of accomplishing something.&lt;p&gt;I like LLMs to get me to reword something, since I struggle with that. But just like in programming I focus it on a specific sentence or two. Otherwise why am I doing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once published a method for finding the closest distance between an ellipse and a point on SO: &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22959698/distance-from-given-point-to-given-ellipse#answer-46007540" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22959698/distance-from-g...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consider it the most beautiful piece of code I've ever written and perhaps my one minor contribution to human knowledge. It uses a method I invented, is just a few lines, and converges in very few iterations.&lt;p&gt;People used to reach out to me all the time with uses they had found for it, it was cited in a PhD and apparently lives in some collision plugin for unity. Haven't heard from anyone in a long time.&lt;p&gt;It's also my test question for LLMs, and I've yet to see my solution regurgitated. Instead they generate some variant of Newtons method, ChatGPT 5.2 gave me an LM implementation and acknowledged that Newtons method is unstable (it is, which is why I went down the rabbit hole in the first place.)&lt;p&gt;Today I don't know where I would publish such a gem. It's not something I'd bother writing up in a paper, and SO was the obvious place were people who wanted an answer to this question would look. Now there is no central repository, instead everyone individually summons the ghosts of those passed in loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some comments:&lt;p&gt;- This is a really remarkable graph. I just didn't realize how thoroughly it was over for SO. It stuns me as much as when Encyclopædia Britannica stopped selling print versions a mere 9 years after the publication of Wikipedia, but at an even faster timescale.&lt;p&gt;- I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning. The fundamental value proposition of SO is getting an answer to a question; if you can the same answer faster, you don't need SO. I suspect that the gradual decline, beginning around 2016, is due to growth in a number of other sources of answers. Reddit is kind of a dark horse here, as I began seeing answers on Google to more modern technical questions link to a Reddit thread frequently along with SO from 2016 onwards. I also suspect Discord played a part, though this is harder to gauge; I certainly got a number of answers to questions for, e.g., Bun, by asking around in the Bun Discord, etc. The final nail in the coffin is of course LLMs, which can offer a SO-level answer to a decent percentage of questions instantly. (The fact that the LLM doesn't insult you is just the cherry on top.)&lt;p&gt;- I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but what happens now? Despite stratification I mentioned above, SO was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions. What do LLMs train off of now? I wonder if, 10 years from now, LLMs will still be answering questions that were answered in the halcyon 2014-2020 days of SO better than anything that came after? Or will we find new, better ways to find answers to technical questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in this thread are missing another key component in the decline of StackOverflow - the more experienced you become, the less useful it is.&lt;p&gt;The harder the problem, the less engagement it gets. People who spend hours working on your issue are rewarded with a single upvote. Meanwhile, "how do I concat a string" gets dozens or hundreds of upvotes.&lt;p&gt;The incentive/reward structure punished experienced folks with challenging/novel questions.&lt;p&gt;Pair that with the toxic moderation and trigger-happy close-votes, you get a zombie community with little new useful content.&lt;/p&gt;
