&lt;p&gt;Last time I flew Delta they no longer had this bot, which made me sad. One of my favorite parts of flying was getting absolutely crushed into a tiny cube by the airplane seat's easy chess bot, and then again by the airplane seat itself when the person in front of me reclines their seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's so important to remember that unlike code which can be reverted - most file system and application operations cannot.&lt;p&gt;There's no sandboxing snapshot in revision history, rollbacks, or anything.&lt;p&gt;I expect to see many stories from parents, non-technical colleagues, and  students who irreparably ruined their computer.&lt;p&gt;Edit: most comments are focused on pointing out that version control  &amp; file system snapshot exists: that's wonderful, but Claude Cowork does not use it.&lt;p&gt;For those of us who have built real systems at low levels I think the alarm bells go off seeing a tool like this - particularly one targeted at non-technical users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for a moment that this meant they had come up with a design that was safe against lethal trifecta / prompt injection attacks, maybe by running everything in a tight sandbox and shutting down any exfiltration vectors that could be used by a malicious prompt attack to steal data.&lt;p&gt;Sadly they haven't completely solved that yet. Instead their help page at &lt;a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork-safely" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13364135-using-cowork...&lt;/a&gt; tells users "Avoid granting access to local files with sensitive information, like financial documents" and "Monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection".&lt;p&gt;(I don't think it's fair to ask non-technical users to look out for "suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection" personally!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would be interesting to train a cutting edge model with a cut off date of say 1900 and then prompt it about QM and relativity with some added context.&lt;p&gt;If the model comes up with anything even remotely correct it would be quite a strong evidence that LLMs are a path to something bigger if not then I think it is time to go back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing was on the wall the moment Apple stopped trying to buy their way into the server-side training game like what three years ago?&lt;p&gt;Apple has the best edge inference silicon in the world (neural engine), but they have effectively zero presence in a training datacenter. They simply do not have the TPU pods or the H100 clusters to train a frontier model like Gemini 2.5 or 3.0 from scratch without burning 10 years of cash flow.&lt;p&gt;To me, this deal is about the bill of materials for intelligence. Apple admitted that the cost of training SOTA models is a capex heavy-lift they don't want to own. Seems like they are pivoting to becoming the premium "last mile" delivery network for someone else's intelligence. Am I missing the elephant in the room?&lt;p&gt;It's a  smart move. Let Google burn the gigawatts training the trillion parameter model. Apple will just optimize the quantization and run the distilled version on the private cloud compute nodes. I'm oversimplifying but this effectively turns the iPhone into a dumb terminal for Google's brain, wrapped in Apple's privacy theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Modern TVs are very poorly suited for kids. They require using complicated remotes or mobile phones, and navigating apps that continually try to lure you into watching something else than you intended to.&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that's not too different for grown-ups. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did not. Anthropic is protecting its huge asset: the Claude Code value chain, which has proven itself to be a winner among devs (me included, after trying everything under the sun in 2025). If anything, Anthropic's mistake is that they are incapable of monetizing their great models in the chat market, where ChatGPT reigns: ie. Anthropic did not invest in image generation, Google did and Gemini has a shot at the market now.&lt;p&gt;Apparently nobody gets the Anthropic move: they are only good at coding and that's a very thin layer. Opencode and other tools are game for collecting inputs and outputs that can later be used to train their own models - not necessarily being done now, but they could - Cursor did it. Also Opencode makes it all easily swappable, just eval something by popping another API key and let's see if Codex or GLM can replicate the CC solution. Oh, it does! So let's cancel Claude and save big bucks!&lt;p&gt;Even though CC the agent supports external providers (via the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL env var), they are working hard on making it impossible for other models to support their every increasing agent feature set (skills, teleport and remote sessions, LSP, Chrome integration, etc). The move totally makes sense, like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; In my friend circle in Germany I don't even know one single person on this stuff.&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t announce when they’re taking a new medication.&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs are popular in Germany, too. Not quite to the level of some other countries but a quick search shows about 1 in 12 individuals in Germany.&lt;p&gt;Note that the US number quoted above was for &lt;i&gt;households&lt;/i&gt; not individuals, so the numbers of households in Germany with at least one member on a GLP-1 is higher. This isn’t a uniquely American phenomenon, despite attempts to turn this into another America-bad comment thread.&lt;p&gt;&gt; It's insane to me that so many people need these to get off the processed foods killing them in the US.&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs don’t make people stop eating processed food. They reduce food intake and cravings. It’s still up to the user to make healthy choices about what to eat.&lt;p&gt;Also it’s been about a decade since I visited family friends in Germany but there was plenty of processed food to be had when I was there, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBH, it all feels like a huge gamble at this point. Neither skills, education, institutional ties, nor current employment can guarantee a stable foundation for life.&lt;p&gt;This hits harder depending on how much money, social capital, or debt you accumulated before this volatility began. If you’ve paid off your debts, bought a house, and stabilized your family life, you’re gambling with how comfortable the coming years will be. If you’re a fresh grad with student debt, no house, and no social network, you’re more or less gambling with your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; non-trivial coding tasks&lt;p&gt;I’ve come back to the idea LLMs are super search engines. If you ask it a narrow, specific question, with one answer, you may well get &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; answer. For the “non-trivial” questions, there always will be multiple answers, and you’ll get from the LLM &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of these depending on the precise words you use to prompt it. You won’t get the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; answer, and in a complex scenario requiring highly recursive cross-checks— some answers you get won’t be functional.&lt;p&gt;It’s not readily apparent at first blush the LLM is doing this, giving &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the answers. And, for a novice who doesn’t know the options, or an expert who can scan a list of options quickly and steer the LLM, it’s incredibly useful. But giving &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the answers without strong guidance on non-trivial architectural points— entropy. LLMs churning independently quickly devolve into entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't understand the stance that AI currently is able to automate away non-trivial coding tasks. I've tried this consistently since GPT 3.5 came out, with every single SOTA model up to GPT 5.1 Codex Max and Opus 4.5. Every single time, I get something that works, yes, but then when I start self-reviewing the code, preparing to submit it to coworkers, I end up rewriting about 70% of the thing. So many important details are subpar about the AI solution, and many times fundamental architectural issues cripple any attempt at prompting my way out of it, even though I've been quite involved step-by-step through the whole prototyping phase.&lt;p&gt;I just have to conclude 1 of 2 things:&lt;p&gt;1) I'm not good at prompting, even though I am one of the earliest AI in coding adopters I know, and have been consistent for years. So I find this hard to accept.&lt;p&gt;2) Other people are just less picky than I am, or they have a less thorough review culture that lets subpar code slide more often.&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what else I can take from the situation. For context, I work on a 15 year old Java Spring + React (with some old pages still in Thymeleaf) web application. There are many sub-services, two separate databases,and this application needs to also 2-way interface with customer hardware. So, not a simple project, but still. I can't imagine it's way more complicated than most enterprise/legacy projects...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that an "observability stack" is going to replace shell access on a server does not resonate with me at all. The metrics I monitor with prometheus and grafana are useful, vital even, but they are always fighting the last war. What I need are tools for when the unknown happens.&lt;p&gt;The tool that manages all my tools is the shell. It is where I attach a debugger, it is where I install iotop and use it for the first time. It is where I cat out mysterious /proc and /sys values to discover exotic things about cgroups I only learned about 5 minutes prior in obscure system documentation. Take it away and you are left with a server that is resilient against things you have seen before but lacks the tools to deal with the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying things after installing Tahoe for me, that for no good reason an ordinary app would randomly lose its focus. In the midst of my typing. This is unbelievably preposterous and I just can't stop hating Apple for this crap. How the fuck this is acceptable? I just have no words. What makes it even worse that I couldn't even complain about it on their support pages - they just keep removing my comments for being "non-constructive". This is some random bug, and many people have complained about it, how am I suppose to make it "more constructive"? Send them the exact configuration of constellations, the number of monitors I use and their positioning angles, log the keyboard rate and delay, the latency, the level of magnetic interference caused by my Bluetooth devices, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd rather expose a Wireguard port and control my keys than introduce a third party like Tailscale.&lt;p&gt;I am not sure why people are so afraid of exposing ports. I have dozens of ports open on my server including SMTP, IMAP(S), HTTP(S), various game servers and don't see a problem with that. I can't rule out a vulnerability somewhere but services are containerized and/or run as separate UNIX users. It's the way the Internet is meant to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This posts lists inexpensive home servers, Tailscale and Claude Code as the big unlocks.&lt;p&gt;I actually think Tailscale may be an even bigger deal here than sysadmin help from Claude Code at al.&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason I had not to run a home server was security: I'm worried that I might fall behind on updates and end up compromised.&lt;p&gt;Tailscale dramatically reduces this risk, because I can so easily configure it so my own devices can talk to my home server from anywhere in the world without the risk of exposing any ports on it directly to the internet.&lt;p&gt;Being able to hit my home server directly from my iPhone via a tailnet no matter where in the world my iPhone might be is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is very well presented and it highlights how absolutely bizarre the latest update was. The video demonstration was also very well done.&lt;p&gt;I remember a few years ago, people complained when Apple merely made the entire operating system uglier. (Something about a gradient on the battery?) A lot of people would talk hyperbolically ("apple KILLED macos!"), and that's indistinguishable to an outsider when an update like this brings other people out of the woodwork to say, "Hey, these changes are genuinely bizarre and absurd, what happened?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tahoe is a macOS mis-step on par with  Windows 8 or Windows Vista. If you’re from Apple and reading this, my feedback is pretty succinct: “I don’t recommend others upgrade. I wish I didn’t.”&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Apple, Windows 11 is not exactly in a position to attract switchers.&lt;p&gt;Let’s see if Apple can turn things around. iOS 8+ did improve on iOS 7’s worst bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86.&lt;p&gt;Even that "modern" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad.&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks).&lt;p&gt;The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person.&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.&lt;p&gt;Do you care about printing?

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth acknowledging the real challenges raised in this thread: desktop Linux still has rough edges for some use cases, hardware support isn’t always perfect, and niche professional software may lack native support or require workarounds. But these obstacles are not intrinsic technical limitations so much as ecosystem and investment gaps, areas where community projects, standards efforts, and wider adoption could drive improvement without sacrificing freedom.&lt;p&gt;Viewed through the lens of digital autonomy and citizenship, the question isn’t simply “Is Linux perfect?” but rather: Do we want our fundamental computing environment to be ultimately under our control, or controlled by private interests with their own incentives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re right of course. For me there’s no flow state possible with LLM “coding”. That makes it feel miserable instead of joyous. Sitting around waiting while it spits out tokens that I then have to carefully look over and tweak feels like very hard work. Compared to entering flow and churning out those tokens myself, which feels effortless once I get going.&lt;p&gt;Probably other people feel differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building.&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is not the same for everyone. For some people, the "fire" is literally about "I control a computer", for others "I'm solving a problem for others", and yet for others "I made something that made others smile/cry/feel emotions" and so on.&lt;p&gt;I think there is a section of programmer who actually do like the actual typing of letters, numbers and special characters into a computer, and for them, I understand LLMs remove the fun part. For me, I initially got into programming because I wanted to ruin other people's websites, then I figured out I needed to know how to build websites first, then I found it more fun to create and share what I've done with others, and they tell me what they think of it. That's my "fire". But I've met so many people who doesn't care an iota about sharing what they built with others, it matters nothing to them.&lt;p&gt;I guess the conclusion is, not all programmers program for the same reason, for some of us, LLMs helps a lot, and makes things even more fun. For others, LLMs remove the core part of what makes programming fun for them. Hence we get this constant back and forth of "Can't believe others can work like this!" vs "I can't believe others aren't working like this!", but both sides seems to completely miss the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don't understand about this whole "get on board the AI train or get left behind" narrative, what advantage does an early adopter have for AI tools?&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, I can just start using AI once they get good enough for my type of work. Until then I'm continuing to learn instead of letting my brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in New Brunswick. It is a strange place politically.&lt;p&gt;I find it wild that the BBC never mentioned the most glaring underbelly of this:&lt;p&gt;New Brunswicks most significant employer for the past 100 years is Irving Oil &amp; Irving Paper and Irving Forestry. They are different arms of a privately held family-run business, run by the descendants of the original founder (whose records are not as public as a traded company), in charge of the main industries of the province. They owned every newspaper in the province, and are known to be adversarial to any community paper, starting new papers just to drive out of business the small upstarts they don't own -- I've seen it play out in my community. People are literally afraid to criticize this family publicly, because they fund SO MUCH of the nonprofit sector. If you are trying to get a project off the ground, you can't look sideways at them or your project will be buried. And their papers certainly won't speak kindly of your criticism.&lt;p&gt;And most glaringly, one of their ex-Vice Presidents was premier of the province during this time.&lt;p&gt;So there is an extra level of concern that some locals have about the optics of the province shutting down the research.&lt;p&gt;The Irving family is highly manipulative of political affairs, and imho have held the province back for decades (e.g. influencing what schools get funded/built, to create the working stock that support their businesses, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you buy a consumer product labeled "military grade" you are buying snake oil. And not just snake oil, incredibly over priced snake oil.&lt;/p&gt;
