&lt;p&gt;The pattern that gets missed in these discussions: every "no-code will replace developers" wave actually creates more developer jobs, not fewer.&lt;p&gt;COBOL was supposed to let managers write programs. VB let business users make apps. Squarespace killed the need for web developers. And now AI.&lt;p&gt;What actually happens: the tooling lowers the barrier to entry, way more people try to build things, and then those same people need actual developers when they hit the edges of what the tool can do. The total surface area of "stuff that needs building" keeps expanding.&lt;p&gt;The developers who get displaced are the ones doing purely mechanical work that was already well-specified. But the job of understanding what to build in the first place, or debugging why the automated thing isn't doing what you expected - that's still there. Usually there's more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; This was the world of Dilbert’s rise. You’d put a Dilbert comic on your cubicle wall, and feel like you’d gotten away with something&lt;p&gt;My former manager used to have Dilbert comic strips on his wall. It always puzzled me - was it self deprecating humor? At a certain point though it became clear that in his mind the PHB was one layer ABOVE him in the management chain and not anyone at his level. I suspect it may be a recursive pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Microsoft says that entering the command "shutdown /s /t 0" at the command prompt will, in fact, force your PC to turn off, whether it wants to or not.&lt;p&gt;Wow how the tables have turned…the argument used to be you used Windows instead of Linux because on Linux you might occasionally have to use the scary terminal to fix an issue haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disliked Adams, but this is a good eulogy.&lt;p&gt;&gt;For Adams, God took a more creative and – dare I say, crueler – route. He created him only-slightly-above-average at everything except for a world-historical, Mozart-tier, absolutely Leonardo-level skill at making silly comics about hating work.&lt;p&gt;A+, no notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fun app.&lt;p&gt;One way I deal with people talking on speakerphone, is inviting myself into their conversation and making comments as if I were an active participant. That usually earns me a weird look, and then they go off speaker so I can't hear what's been said. Success.&lt;p&gt;Similar with folks watching reels on speaker, I fake a laugh or make comments about the content. It's awkward enough that they usually stop because they want a moment alone, not an interactive session with a stranger. Which ironically is the same thing I want too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds exactly like what Google used to say about search results. Just a few ads, clearly separated from organic results, never detracting from the core mission of providing the most effective access to all the world’s information. (And certainly not driven by a secret profile of you based on pervasive surveillance of your internet activity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I were sitting in the coffee shop/dining area of our grocery store not long ago, eating breakfast before we bought our groceries. There's a gentleman who's usually there on the same weekend days that we are, and he watches videos on his phone &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; loudly. It was clearly annoying everyone around, but this being Minnesota, nobody was going to bother him about it (instead they just do little glances over their shoulder or the "OPE" eyes at each other lol).&lt;p&gt;Finally, one older woman gets up and walks over to him. My wife and I are like "Oh shit, she's gonna let him have it, here it comes." She taps him on the shoulder and says "Excuse me, can you turn that down? It's very loud." And you know what he did? He said "Oh, sorry," and turned it down.&lt;p&gt;She said thanks and went back to her seat, simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's one I don't know how to solve: at work some folks take meetings in the bathroom.  They're on their phone, they walk to a stall, do their... business while doing their business, all the while talking and listening, while toilets flush in the background.&lt;p&gt;I understand cultural differences but taking business meetings in the bathroom seems inappropriate under effectively all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the style of cheap tiktoks: "There are two types of people...". My wife loves listening to her phone on max volume, but it sounds so bad compared to half decent speakers.&lt;p&gt;Also what's up with the people hiking (by themselves) with a bluetooth speaker. You're by yourself, in nature. If you want to listen to music wear headphones!!&lt;p&gt;Also why are people using speaker phones in public places at max volume. The speaker in your phone is designed to deliver the sound directly to your ear, probably at higher fidelity.&lt;p&gt;I'm loving the fact that battery technology will eventually eliminate weed wackers.&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I sound cranky, I find loud noises challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a complete sea change. I feel Canada only set tariffs on cars out of some deference to the US auto industry. I don’t want to use slippery slope thinking, but this to me smells like rolling out a Canadian auto market that is not dependent on the US.&lt;p&gt;For the average family, being able to spend significantly less on a car is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, "resolving merge conflicts along the way" doesn't mean anything, as there are two trivial merge strategies that are always guaranteed to work ('ours' and 'theirs').&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation is usually: devs can write their own tests. We don't need QA.&lt;p&gt;And the first part is true. We can. But that's not why we have (had) QA.&lt;p&gt;First: it's not the best use of our time. I believe dev and QA are separate skillset. Of course there is overlap.&lt;p&gt;Second, and most important: it's a separate person, an additional person who can question the ticket, and who can question my translation of the ticket into software.&lt;p&gt;And lastly: they don't suffer from the curse of knowledge on how I implemented the ticket.&lt;p&gt;I miss my QA colleagues. When I joined my current employer there were 8 or so. Initially I was afraid to give them my work, afraid of bad feedback.&lt;p&gt;Never have I met such graceful people who took the time in understanding something, and talking to me to figure out where there was a mismatch.&lt;p&gt;And then they were deemed not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Not sure you want to run a 3rd party shell script just to do that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding (not necessarily reading) always was the real work. AI makes people &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; productive because it's speeding up the thing that wasn't hard (generating code), while generating additional burden on the thing that was hard (understanding the code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the problem is not a low success rate, but the burnout from being the only person that invites people to do things. At a certain point you want to see some reciprocation to create community. It can definitely happen, but a lot of folks still fall back on the habits. You have to invite and then also start asking people who's gonna host the next one and get them on the hook, and then not burnout from being a constant organizer :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this but I think you'll be surprised at your success rate.  &lt;i&gt;Everyone&lt;/i&gt; is struggling with this, not just you.  Right on the heels of covid we were debating whether to have a NYE party or just go to a friend's house for a low key thing.  We were paralyzed a bit feeling like, why we weren't invited to other parties ourselves?  Won't everyone already be busy doing other stuff?  In the end my wife took the leap and invited a ton of neighbors and friends.  Guess what??  Almost everyone showed up!  Which means all those people were going to be sitting at home feeling bad and wondering the same thing.  You just need to believe and get over it, people want to hang out.  We've all just gotten out of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
