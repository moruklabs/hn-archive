&lt;p&gt;Regarding just the headline, at this point it's not really about immigration, this has evolved into a soft civil conflict being waged for political reasons. The two people who have been killed so far were themselves citizens and at best were political dissidents. They were not themselves subject to detainment due to immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of jeering, I suspect at the headline more than anything, but having documented research can be helpful in changing management behavior. The changes in employee behavior documented here are not ones that managers would easily connect to &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; past behavior, such as a late birthday recognition.&lt;p&gt;When you train a dog, you have to give a reward very soon after the desired behavior, otherwise the dog won't associate the reward with the behavior. Likewise, a manager is not going to associate a slight towards an employee with an increase in absenteeism or lower productivity that happens days and weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth knowing in this context:&lt;p&gt;Telephones only want a twisted pair. Ethernet, popular with businesses for decades, also wants a twisted pair. Now, that pair must meet much stricter criteria to be suitable, such as Category 5 (for 100Mbit) or Category 5e (1000Mbit ie Gigabit) - but it really is just twisted pair cable, merely a tighter specification than your phone.&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are a sparky (electrician) and you have some jobs where you are to install telephone connections, some where you put in "Ethernet" (presumably 100baseT would be fine) and some they specifically want you to wire for Gigabit.&lt;p&gt;You &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; go to your wholesaler and buy a reel of Cat3 phone cable, a reel of Cat5 100baseT Ethernet, and a third reel of Cat 5e Gigabit cable, and take the right one for each job. So long as you do this flawlessly you can probably save a few pounds every year by using a slightly cheaper cable for some jobs.&lt;p&gt;Or, you can buy one reel of Cat5e and use that for all these jobs and since it's the same reel you can't have the wrong one and don't need to check paperwork to know you've put the correct cable in a duct etc. Thought that was a phone line but now the client insists it's data? No problem, they're the exact same cable, just smile and agree.&lt;p&gt;When I bought the place where I live now I wanted GigE to this desk, even though the DSL comes into a different room. I didn't love the idea of cutting holes in walls but I was resigned to maybe needing that, except there's a phone extension in this room (like the author says, we do love phone extensions) and so that room the DSL comes into has a twisted pair to here. I opened up the box, and I'm like huh, that's Cat5e, and sure enough this entire building was wired with Cat5e because like I said, why not, it's basically the same cable, why carry a separate reel?&lt;p&gt;So I changed the face plates from telephone to Ethernet, and I'm done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Haim once ascended to the firmaments to see the difference between the worlds. He first visited Gehenna (Hell).&lt;p&gt;He saw a vast hall with long tables covered in the most magnificent foods. But the people sitting there were skeletal and wailing in agony. As the Rabbi looked closer, he saw that every person had wooden slats splinted to their arms, stretching from their shoulders to their wrists. Their arms were perfectly straight and stiff; they could pick up a spoon, but they could not bend their elbows to bring the food to their own mouths. They sat in front of a feast, starving in bitterness.&lt;p&gt;The Rabbi then visited Gan Eden (Heaven). To his surprise, he saw the exact same hall, the same tables, and the same magnificent food. Even more shocking, the people there also had wooden slats splinted to their arms, keeping them from bending their elbows.
 But here, the hall was filled with laughter and song. The people were well-fed and glowing. As the Rabbi watched, he saw a man fill his spoon and reach across the table, placing the food into the mouth of the man sitting opposite him. That man, in turn, filled his spoon and fed his friend.&lt;p&gt;The Rabbi returned to Hell and whispered to one of the starving men, "You do not have to starve! Reach across and feed your neighbor, and he will feed you."
 The man in Hell looked at him with spite and replied, "What? You expect me to feed that fool across from me? I would rather starve than give him the pleasure of a full belly!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing particularly notable here. A lot of it seems to be 'We have something in-house designed for our use cases, use that instead of the standard lib equivalent'.&lt;p&gt;The rest looks very reasonable, like avoiding locale-hell.&lt;p&gt;Some of it is likely options that sand rough edges off of the standard lib, which is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Tesla, without subscription, now has worse Steering Assist than a $22K Toyota Corolla.&lt;p&gt;Back when Autopilot launched, in consumer cars, it was pretty unique. But the market has moved on significantly, and basic Steering Assist/Full-Speed-Range Automatic Cruise Control, are pretty universal features today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; make sure not to sign into your Microsoft account or link it to Windows again&lt;p&gt;That's not so easy. Microsoft tries really hard to get you to use a Microsoft account. For example, logging into MS Teams will automatically link your local account with the Microsoft account, thus starting the automatic upload of all kinds of stuff unrelated to MS Teams.&lt;p&gt;In the past I also had Edge importing Firefox data (including stored passwords) without me agreeing to do so, and then uploading those into the Cloud.&lt;p&gt;Nowadays you just need to assume that all data on Windows computers is available to Microsoft; even if you temporarily find a way to keep your data out of their hands, an update will certainly change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Claude Code is starting to fall over from being entirely written by LLMs. How do you even begin to fix precise bugs in a 1M+ LOC codebase all written by AI? It seems like LLMs are great for quickly adding large new features but not great for finding and fixing edge-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Any power users who prefer their own key management should follow the steps to enable Bitlocker without uploading keys to a connected Microsoft account.&lt;p&gt;Except the steps to to that are disable bitlocker, create a local user account (assuming you initially signed in with a Microsoft account because Ms now forces it on you for home editions of windows), delete your existing keys from OneDrive, then re-encrypt using your local account and make sure not to sign into your Microsoft account or link it to Windows again.&lt;p&gt;A much more sensible default would be to give the user a choice right from the beginning much like how Apple does it. When you go through set up assistant on mac, it doesn't assume you are an idiot and literally asks you up front "Do you want to store your recovery key in iCloud or not?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's interesting how many comments these days are like, "well of course".&lt;p&gt;Back in the day hackernews had some fire and resistance.&lt;p&gt;Too many tech workers decided to rollover for the government and that's why we are in this mess now.&lt;p&gt;This isn't an argument about law, it's about designing secure systems. And lazy engineers build lazy key escrow the government can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point they seem to be making is that AI can "orchestrate" the real world even if it can't interact physically. I can definitely believe that in 2026 someone at their computer with access to money can send the right emails and make the right bank transfers to get real people to grow corn for you.&lt;p&gt;However even by that metric I don't see how Claude is doing that. Seth is the one researching the suppliers "with the help of" Claude. Seth is presumably the one deciding when to prompt Claude to make decisions about if they should plant in Iowa in how many days. I think I could also grow corn if someone came and asked me well defined questions and then acted on what I said. I might even be better at it because unlike a Claude output I will still be conscious in 30 seconds.&lt;p&gt;That is a far cry from sitting down at a command like and saying "Do everything necessary to grow 500 bushels of corn by October".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, I’m one of the Very Serious Engineers and I liked Steve’s post when I thought it was sort of tongue in cheek but was horrified to come to the HN comments and LinkedIn comments proclaiming Gastown as the future of engineering. There absolutely is a large contingent of engineers who believe this, and it has a real world impact on my job if my bosses think you can just throw a dozen AI agents at our product roadmap and get better productivity than an engineer. This is not whimsical to me, I’m getting burnt out trying to navigate the absurd expectations of investors and executives with the real world engineering concerns of my day to day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI BitLocker is on by default in Windows 11. The defaults will also upload the BitLocker key to a Microsoft Account if available.&lt;p&gt;This is why the FBI can compel Microsoft to provide the keys. It's possible, perhaps even likely, that the suspect didn't even know they had an encrypted laptop. Journalists love the "Microsoft &lt;i&gt;gave&lt;/i&gt;" framing because it makes Microsoft sound like they're handing these out because they like the cops, but that's not how it works. If your company has data that the police want and they can get a warrant, you have no choice but to give it to them.&lt;p&gt;This makes the privacy purists angry, but in my opinion it's the reasonable default for the average computer user. It protects their data in the event that someone steals the laptop, but still allows them to recover their own data later from the hard drive.&lt;p&gt;Any power users who prefer their own key management should follow the steps to enable Bitlocker without uploading keys to a connected Microsoft account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; If you read Steve's writeup, it's clear that this is a big fun experiment:&lt;p&gt;So, Steve has the big scary "YOU WILL DIE" statements in there, but he also has this:&lt;p&gt;&gt; I went ahead and built what’s next. First I predicted it, back in March, in Revenge of the Junior Developer. I predicted someone would lash the Claude Code camels together into chariots, and that is exactly what I’ve done with Gas Town. I’ve tamed them to where you can use 20–30 at once, productively, on a sustained basis.&lt;p&gt;"What's next"? Not an experiment. A prediction about how we'll work. The word "productively"? "Productively" is not just "a big fun experiment." "Productively" is what you say when you've got something people should use.&lt;p&gt;Even when he's giving the warnings, he says things like "If you have any doubt whatsoever, then you can’t use it" implying that it's ready for the right sort of person to use, or "Working effectively in Gas Town involves committing to vibe coding.", implying that working effectively with it is possible.&lt;p&gt;Every day, I go on Hacker News, and see the responses to a post where someone has an inconsistent message in their blog post like this.&lt;p&gt;If you say two different and contradictory things, and do not very explicitly resolve them, and say which one is the final answer, you will get blamed for both things you said, and you will not be entitled to complain about it, because you did it to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't get the widespread hatred of Gas Town. If you read Steve's writeup, it's clear that this is a big fun experiment.&lt;p&gt;It pushes and crosses boundaries, it is a mixture of technology and art, it is provocative. It takes stochastic neural nets and mashes them together in bizarre ways to see if anything coherent comes out the other end.&lt;p&gt;And the reaction is a bunch of Very Serious Engineers who cross their arms and harumph at it for being Unprofessional and Not Serious and Not Ready For Production.&lt;p&gt;I often feel like our industry has lost its sense of whimsy and experimentation from the early days, when people tried weird things to see what would work and what wouldn't.&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because we also have suits telling us we have to use neural nets everywhere for everything Or Else, and there's no sense of fun in that.&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's the natural consequence of large-scale professionalization, and stock option plans and RSUs and levels and sprints and PMs, that today's gray hoodie is just the updated gray suit of the past but with no less dryness of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the author is correct to a point but I don't believe the examples they've chosen provide the best support for their case. Gen Z buying iPods and people buying N64 games again is not evidence of the monoculture breaking apart - it's a retreat into the past for the enlightened few because their needs are not being met by modern goods and services. You cannot buy a dedicated MP3 player today with the software polish and quality of life that an iPod had in the early 2000s (or even a Zune).&lt;p&gt;Instead, I see the growth and momentum behind Linux and self-hosting as better evidence that change is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's because a lot of people that werent skilful werent on your path before.
Now that pandora's box has been re-opened, those people feel "they get a second chance at life". It's not that they have no shame, they have no perspective to put that shame.&lt;p&gt;You on the other hand, have for many years honed your craft. The more you learn, the more you discover to learn aka , you realize how little you know. 
They don't have this. _At all_.
They see this as a "free ticket to the front row" and when we politely push back (we should be way harsher in this, its the only language they understand) all they hear is "he doesn't like _me_." which is an escape.&lt;p&gt;You know how much work you ask of me, when you open a PR on my project, they don't. They will just see it as "why don't you let me join, since I have AI I should have the same skill as you".... unironically.&lt;p&gt;In other words, these "other people" that we talk about haven't worked a day in the field in their life, so they simply don't understand much of it, however they feel they understand everything of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find particularly ironic is that the title make it feel like Rust gives a 5x performance improvement when it actually slows thing down.&lt;p&gt;The problem they have software written in Rust, and they need to use the libpg_query library, that is written in C. Because they can't use the C library directly, they had to use a Rust-to-C binding library, that uses Protobuf for portability reasons. Problem is that it is slow.&lt;p&gt;So what they did is that they wrote their own non-portable but much more optimized Rust-to-C bindings, with the help of a LLM.&lt;p&gt;But had they written their software in C, they wouldn't have needed to do any conversion at all. It means they could have titled the article "How we lowered the performance penalty of using Rust".&lt;p&gt;I don't know much about Rust or libpg_query, but they probably could have gone even faster by getting rid of the conversion entirely. It would most likely have involved major adaptations and some unsafe Rust though. Writing a converter has many advantages: portability, convenience, security, etc... but it has a cost, and ultimately, I think it is a big reason why computers are so fast and apps are so slow. Our machines keep copying, converting, serializing and deserializing things.&lt;p&gt;Note: I have nothing against what they did, quite the opposite, I always appreciate those who care about performance, and what they did is reasonable and effective, good job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Famously Steve Jobs said that the (personal) computer is "like a bicycle for the mind". It's a great metaphor because- besides the idea of lightness and freedom it communicates- it also described the computer as multiplier of the human strength- the bicycle allows one to travel faster and with much less effort, it's true, but ultimately the source of its power is still entirely in the muscles of the cyclist- you don't get out of it anything that you didn't put yourself.&lt;p&gt;Bu the feeling I'm having with LLMs is that we've entered the age of fossil-fuel engines: something that moves on its own power and produces somewhat more than the user needs to put into it. Ok, in the current version it might not go very far and needs to be pushed now and then, but the total energy output is greater than what users need to put in. We could call it a horse, except that this is artificial: it's a tractor. And in the last months I've been feeling like someone who spent years pushing a plough in the fields, and has suddenly received a tractor. A primitive model, still imperfect, but already working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the title a bit misleading. I think it should be titled It’s Faster to Copy Memory Directly than Send a Protobuf. Which then seems rather obvious that removing a serialization and deserialization step reduces runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest surprise to me with all this low-quality contribution spam is how little shame people apparently have. I have a handful of open source contributions. All of them are for small-ish projects and the complexity of my contributions are in the same ball-park as what I work on day-to-day. And even though I am relatively confident in my competency as a developer, these contributions are probably the most thoroughly tested and reviewed pieces of code I have ever written. I just really, really don't want to bother someone with low quality "help" who graciously offers their time to work on open source stuff.&lt;p&gt;Other people apparently don't have this feeling at all. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised by this, but I've definitely been caught off guard by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google quietly announced that Programmable Search (ex-Custom Search) won’t allow new engines to “search the entire web” anymore. New engines are capped at searching up to 50 domains, and existing full-web engines have until Jan 1, 2027 to transition.&lt;p&gt;If you actually need whole-web search, Google now points you to an “interest form” for enterprise solutions (Vertex AI Search etc.), with no public pricing and no guarantee they’ll even reply.&lt;p&gt;This seems like it effectively ends the era of indie / niche search engines being able to build on Google’s index. Anything that looks like general web search is getting pushed behind enterprise gates.&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen much discussion about this yet, but for anyone who built a small search product on Programmable Search, this feels like a pretty big shift.&lt;p&gt;Curious if others here are affected or already planning alternatives.&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I logged into Programmable Search and the message is even more explicit: Full web search via the "Search the entire web" feature will be discontinued within the next year. Please update your search engine to specify specific sites to search.

&lt;p&gt;I disagree: in as much as I have noticed this *far* more with AI than any other advancement / fad (depending on your opinion) than anything else before.&lt;p&gt;This also tracks with every app and website injecting AI into every one of your interactions, with no way to disable it.&lt;p&gt;I think the article's point about non-consent is a very apt one, and expresses why I dislike this trend so much. I left Google Workspace, as a paying customer for years, because they injected gemini into gmail etc and I couldn't turn it off (only those on the most expensive enterprise plans could at the time I left).&lt;p&gt;To be clear I am someone that uses AI basically every day, but the non-consent is still frustrating and dehumanising. Users–even paying users–are "considered" in design these days as much as a cow is "considered" in the design of a dairy farm.&lt;p&gt;I am moving all of the software that I pay for to competitors who either do not integrate AI, or allow me to disable it if I wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we must make it clear that this is not related to AI at all, even if the product in question is AI-related.&lt;p&gt;It is a very common problem with modern marketing teams, that have zero empathy for customers (even if they have one, they will never push back on whatever insane demands come from senior management). This is why any email subscription management interface now is as bloated as a dead whale. If too many users unsubscribe, they just add one more category and “accidentally” opt-in everyone.&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that Proton marketing team is just like every other one. Maybe it’s a curse of growing organization and middle management creep. The least we can do is push back as customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a Mastodon tweet a while ago, which went something like:&lt;p&gt;Do tech companies understand consent?:&lt;p&gt;- [ ] Yes&lt;p&gt;- [ ] Ask me again in a few days&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brex literally came to us one day in 2022, and notified us that "We have 6 weeks to move everything off their service" they told us boldly they are refocusing on the enterprise market and we were only a "SMB". The guy who literally told us this framed it as a good thing for us like it was some sort of weird break up.&lt;p&gt;At the time we had signed a large enterprise agreement not long before that, and we even were advertised as a enterprise customer testimonial. When we mentioned that he said it was final. They ghosted us apparently and from what i heard a bunch of companies were the same somehow no longer acceptable for their services. I had a friend who worked for a very large F500 company who also got a similar treatment.&lt;p&gt;Ironically i had a friend a tiny crypto startup that somehow was allowed to stay despite not meeting their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smells like an article from someone that didn’t really USE the XML ecosystem.&lt;p&gt;First, there is modeling ambiguity, too many ways to represent the same data structure. Which means you can’t parse into native structs but instead into a heavy DOM object and it sucks to interact with it.&lt;p&gt;Then, schemas sound great, until you run into DTD, XSD, and RelaxNG. Relax only exists because XSD is pretty much incomprehensible.&lt;p&gt;Then let’s talk about entity escaping and CDATA. And how you break entire parsers because CDATA is a separate incantation on the DOM.&lt;p&gt;And in practice, XML is always over engineered. It’s the AbstractFactoryProxyBuilder of data formats. SOAP and WSDL are great examples of this, vs looking at a JSON response and simply understanding what it is.&lt;p&gt;I worked with XML and all the tooling around it for a long time. Zero interest in going back. It’s not the angle brackets or the serialization efficiency. It’s all of the above brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
