&lt;p&gt;Tesla also announced they will be discontinuing the basic lane keep + adaptive speed cruise control they helped pioneer in cars sold going forward. But this is now a standard (free) feature even in basic vehicles like the Toyota Corolla. Why would they intentionally cripple their vehicles to the point hat they would be inferior to most cars today?&lt;p&gt;Then I learned that Musk's incentive pay has a 10 million full self-driving subscription hurdle, and it all made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who lives on a residential street right by a primary school in the UK, the majority of drivers are going over 20mph even at the peak time when there are children everywhere.&lt;p&gt;While in theory human drivers should be situationally aware of the higher risks of children being around, the reality is that the majority will be in their own bubble of being late to drop their kid off and searching for the first free spot they can find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup. And to add&lt;p&gt;&gt; Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.”&lt;p&gt;It's likely that a fully-attentive human driver would have done worse. With a distracted driver (a huge portion of human drivers) it could've been catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Waymo blog...&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;the pedestrian suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle's path. Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Following the event, we voluntarily contacted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that same day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly cannot imagine a better outcome or handling of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D and Omega-3 are the two supplements that consistently appear to be super powerful in small studies and then fail to do anything significant at all in larger studies.&lt;p&gt;Pause for a moment and consider the mere plausibility of the claims in the first few paragraphs: The effect size for antidepressants is 0.4, but the effect size for Vitamin D is 1.8? Are we to believe that Vitamin D supplements have an effect size 4.5X larger than antidepressant drugs, and nobody noticed this massive discrepancy until now?&lt;p&gt;Effect size is also a favorite metric in this vein of supplement-over-pharma writing because it’s so commonly misunderstood and it’s so easy to find small supplement studies that have outlier effect sizes.&lt;p&gt;To put it in context, even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study. Have you ever taken Tylenol or Ibuprofen and had a headache or other pain reduced? Well you’ve experience what a drug with a small effect size on paper can do for you.&lt;p&gt;Please be very careful when someone tries to tell you that supplements are miraculous and pharmaceutical drugs don’t work at all. I know too many people who delayed trialing SSRIs for years due to internet driven fears and lost many years of their lives to depression based on content like this. People with cabinets full of dozens of supplement bottles that were chosen based on studies, too. Then they finally decided to try real antidepressant medications and wished they’d done it sooner.&lt;p&gt;As much as I wish we could all just cure depression by taking a simple Vitamin D supplement that has 4.5X higher effect size than antidepressant drugs, this claim just isn’t passable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it's common to hate on antidepressants, I've always personally had a bias against them.&lt;p&gt;For the past 15-20 years, november thru february are basically a writeoff due for me due to seasonal affective disorder. Cold showers, exercise, no alcohol, strict sleeping rituals. Vitamin d. I can still sleep 11 hours and feel like reheated cat shit.&lt;p&gt;Enter citalopram. "It will take up to six weeks to dial in" they said. Within four days I felt like the inside of my head was designed by Apple in their glory days. My mind became an orderly, well lit, tastefully designed space... instead of a dimly lit crack den. I'm more emotionally available, no longer tired, less cranky. I felt cozy. I could cry with joy because I could finally understand emotionally why people like the Christmas season.&lt;p&gt;I won the SSRI lottery I guess, the side effect are sweaty feet, vivid dreams and a dry mouth. That's all.&lt;p&gt;This just goes to show that for me, they're extremely effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not take 5000mg/day of Vitamin D. The author confuses IU and mg which is very dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operating cost is the maximum Apple can come up with when their accountants attribute everything they possibly can to digital sales for the sake of legal argument. R&amp;D shouldn't really be included, and Apple uses those same tools and APIs themselves. I think the actual profit margin is closer to 90%, and Apple could maintain a 20% margin with just a 3–4% fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s App Store profits on commissions from digital sales&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Revenue          $32 B
    Operating Costs   $7 B [1]
    Estimated Profit $25 B 
    Operating Margin ~78%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
[1] R&amp;D, security, hosting, human review, and including building and maintaining developer tools Xcode, APIs, and SDKs.&lt;p&gt;Apple could take just 7% cut and still make 20% profits.&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: During the Epic trial, it was revealed that Apple's profit margins on the App Store were so high that even Apple's own executives were sometimes surprised by the internal financial reports.&lt;p&gt;---&lt;p&gt;edit: There is no ideological argument for voluntary action here. The entire goal is to force regulators to step in. The debate over 'good vs. bad companies' is just online noise and rhetorical trik, no one on either side of the political spectrum wants these systems to be fixed voluntarily with corporate altruism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla will become a case study on how to completely waste the first-mover advantage.&lt;p&gt;For many people, the very term EV itself is still ubiquitous to Tesla.&lt;p&gt;And somehow Tesla is still worth more than every other non-Chinese automaker combined. $1.5T.&lt;p&gt;GM? $80B. Stellantis? $40B. Toyota? $280B. Mercedes-Benz? $60B. BMW? $55B. Volkswagen Group? Also $55B.&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ve missed plenty of others, but I could miss some 18 $50B automakers, and Tesla would still be worth more than all of them combined.&lt;p&gt;If Tesla was valued fairly, it would probably be at the tune of $5B. But I’ll never bet against it, because the markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent. And for some unbeknownst to me reason, the markets value Tesla as a hot tech company, not a 3rd rate automaker, which is what it actually is.&lt;p&gt;And to add insult to injury, even GM Super Cruise is widely renowned as better and safer than Tesla’s current “FSD”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about my banking app! I think it’s only fair Apple take 30% on every transaction I make. After all they put in a huge amount of work validating and making sure my banking app is safe and functional.&lt;p&gt;Edit: Maybe I am greedy now, but it would be nice if large transactions like say buying a house only would cost me a 15% transaction fee to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he milked Tesla for another $2B to subsidize xAI, has dropped the models to 2 (3 and Y), revenue is down, growth is negative, BYD is eating Tesla for lunch, followed by the other CN and KR vehicle companies.&lt;p&gt;He doesn't have FSD, camera only navigation without sensor fusion with LIDAR will fail, the only thing keeping Tesla where it is is the bullshit dispersal field that surrounds Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the same time the 500-mile email problem happened (mid 1990s), I had a difficult to understand issue with my office PC. Every morning, I'd come in, slide my hard drive sled in, and turn the computer on. We had 128 Kbps ISDN internet at the office and I had the same at home, but that was too slow to do much work. So I'd take the drive home so I could work at night, especially in the winter when the office was too cold at night.&lt;p&gt;Suddenly one winter morning, the PC wouldn't boot. I had to run to a meeting. When I got back, I turned the PC off and on again and everything was fine. The next morning, the same thing happened. The third day, I didn't have a meeting. I turned it off and back on, still no boot. I'd gotten in late, so I just turned it off and took an early lunch. When I got back, it still wouldn't boot. But I had a meeting, so I ran to that, leaving the computer on. When I got back, it booted fine.&lt;p&gt;The next morning, same thing. I decided to look inside, not having any idea what might cause such symptoms. As I took the shell off, a tiny mouse came out, jump off my desk, and ran across my lap before jumping on the floor and scurrying out of sight. From inside the computer came the smell of mouse urine. Apparently he'd been crawling in through the open drive bay to keep warm every night, and urinating while he was in there. Once the computer had been on for a while, the heat and airflow would dry it out enough to eliminate whatever electrical short was keeping it from booting. I went to the store and bought an empty drive sled to put in the drive bay whenever I took my drive out, and the problem never came back. I felt lucky that the liquid didn't cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next shoe to drop will be shifting Model Y production from Fremont to Austin. Fremont will make Model 3s. Austin will make Model Ys and Robotaxis/2s. Cybertruck will be canceled. None of the Tesla plants will be making robots at any scale for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That person's pinned message shows that he started his campaign for Congress almost 2 months ago. He says he was laid off today. He's been Tweeting non-stop daily and appears to be working hard on his campaign.&lt;p&gt;I don't think you can separate his active run for Congress from this layoff. Making an actual run for Congress is a huge time commitment and I don't see how it would be compatible with being an L7 manager at Amazon. It's not something you do in your free time.&lt;p&gt;His campaign platform also appears to be about AI taking jobs, so I'm more than a little suspicious that getting laid off was part of the plan rather than an actual surprise.&lt;p&gt;The claim that he "built systems" should also be taken in the context of his job title, which was in product management. I've held the Product Manager title for a few years, but I wouldn't claim "I built" during those times, because I was not the one doing the building. This strikes me as a little misleading.&lt;p&gt;Also that post is full of classic LLM-ism from beginning to end. Note the overuse of the "It's not this, it's that" format and other LLM tells. I might give someone the benefit of the doubt if they were immersed in LLMs so long that they started speaking like an LLM, but given all of the other context surrounding this post I have a high suspicion it was written by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; He told me that he had worked to develop a tool that would replace effectively all of the middle management function that he was responsible for: gathering information from folks below him, distilling it down and reporting that to people above him.&lt;p&gt;Any manager whose job was this simple was on borrowed time anyway.&lt;p&gt;I think the person was feeding you a story around the campfire to impress you. Real management work doesn't operate like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My story is simpler. Microsoft dropped the support for Windows 10 and gave me no upgrade path to Windows 11 because my CPU was 5 years too old apparently.&lt;p&gt;So I installed Fedora on that machine, I learned the process, I went through the hurdles. It wasn’t seamless. But, Fedora never said “I can’t”. When it was over, it was fine.&lt;p&gt;Only if Microsoft had just let me install Windows 11 and suffer whatever the perf problem my CPU would bring. Then I could consider a hardware upgrade then, maybe.&lt;p&gt;But, “you can’t install unless you upgrade your CPU” forced me to adopt Linux. More importantly, it gave me a story to tell.&lt;p&gt;There is a marketing lesson there somewhere, like Torvalds’ famous “you don’t break userspace”, something along the lines of “you don’t break the upgrade path”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I went camping and at the campground next to me was a middle manager at Amazon. I’ve been out of the workforce for about a year, so I asked him how much of an impact AI was having in his role.&lt;p&gt;He told me that he had worked to develop a tool that would replace effectively all of the middle management function that he was responsible for: gathering information from folks below him, distilling it down and reporting that to people above him.&lt;p&gt;His hope was that he would be retained to maintain the system that he built, knowing that every other manager at his level was going to be terminated.&lt;p&gt;It felt like watching someone who is about to be executed be responsible for building the gallows. He should’ve been so aware that his job was going to be the first one cut, and he was responsible for building a tool to cut his own job. But he was optimistic that the cuts wouldn’t come for him&lt;p&gt;Makes me wonder how he’s doing today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just started a new job where I'm subjected to Windows 11. They gave me a behemoth of a laptop. 64GB of RAM, absolute screamer of a CPU, big GPU, the whole deal.&lt;p&gt;Windows 11's file browser lags when opening directories with more than 100-ish files. Windows 11's file browser takes a few seconds to open at all.&lt;p&gt;Context menus take a noticeable amount of time to appear.&lt;p&gt;I'm getting used to a new keyboard, so I keep hitting Print Screen by accident. Half the time I can smack Esc and Snipping Tool will go away. The other half of the time, I have to mouse over and click the X to close it. There is no pattern to when Esc does/doesn't work.&lt;p&gt;If my computer goes to sleep, WSL becomes unresponsive. I have to save all my stuff and reboot to continue working.&lt;p&gt;If Windows 11 struggles &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; badly on a brand new laptop that I'm certain would retail for $4000+, I can only imagine how miserable it is for everyone else. All my colleagues who have been here for a bit longer got last-generation laptops. &lt;i&gt;oof.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit... and besides, what does Windows 11 even &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; that KDE Plasma 5 wasn't doing a decade ago? How did it take &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; long to get a tabbed file browser?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every large company is updating its standard layoffs announcement press release from "economic headwinds" to "AI".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; if you don't sell your games on Steam or in a way I can run them on Linux I am not buying or playing them.&lt;p&gt;So much this. People like to moan about "oh game XYZ doesn't run so it's not reasonable for gaming". More games run on GNU / Linux than any gaming console. There are simply too many games that do run to give a second thought about the ones that don't, and it's been that way for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was me in 2022 or 2023. I have posted on HN about my shift a few times. I gave up with Windows 10 because you needed Windows Pro in order to make an "offline" account, I spent $2000+ for a gaming rig, and I couldn't add new users, one program told me to use the other program which brought me back to the original program... I had to go out of my way, buy a license just to make it work. I just went and installed Linux finally. I was on POP_OS! for a good year, but been on Arch Linux for one year plus now.&lt;p&gt;I know its a "meme" to talk about how great Arch is, but when you want the latest of something, Arch has it. I use EndeavourOS since it had a nicer simpler installer (idk why Arch doesn't invest in whats standard in every other major distro) and if you just use "yay" you don't run into Pacman woes.&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I'm only buying Macs as well, but for my gaming rigs, straight to Arch.  Steam and Proton work perfectly, if you don't sell your games on Steam or in a way I can run them on Linux I am not buying or playing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private surveillance is so much more scary than regular government surveillance because they have every incentive to invent new ways of surveilling you that they then try to sell to governments, or private actors who want to influence the world. It's like classic government surveillance but every company you interacted with and every app you use may at some point turn on you and use your data against you, just because someone realized "hey, I bet we can sell this data"&lt;p&gt;We are really seeing the fears of data collection from the 2000s and 2010s come to fruition as privatized surveillance now. Cambridge analytica should have been the warning shot but it wasn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The press release (&lt;a href="https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengtheni...&lt;/a&gt;) seems remarkably to the point, for CEO press release standards.&lt;p&gt;I'm impressed by their ambition to fire &lt;i&gt;1700 managers&lt;/i&gt;(!) That's a lot of managers! I interviewed with ASML a decade and a half ago and while there was plenty to complain about (eg their tens of millions of lines of absolutely unmaintainable C code), I didn't feel at the time feel like it was a very top-heavy organization. It was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; engineer-y, and I loved that about them. This press release (when taken at face value) suggests that this has changed a lot over time and they're now trying to correct it.&lt;p&gt;I gotta say, if true and not code for general "cheese slicer" cost cutting, I think that this is rather ballsy. Philips (which ASML spun out of) famously never did anything of the sort and gradually cramped into an extremely management-heavy organization where most people just write reports for other people with scary few people actually moving the needle. I think it's cool that ASML has identified that they're risking becoming like Philips and trying to do something about it, even if the method seems rather crude. I think the risk is real. ASML's fast-moving culture formed in a mad multi-decade survival-crunch, but they've been a near-monopolist for a while now and that means those pressures are long gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm dumbfounded they chose the name of the infamous NSA mass surveillance program revealed by Snowden in 2013. And even more so that there is just one other comment among 320 pointing this out [1]. Has the technical and scientific community in the US already forgotten this huge breach of trust? This is especially jarring at a time where the US is burning its political good-will at unprecedented rate (at least unprecedented during the life-times of most of us) and talking about digital sovereignty has become mainstream in Europe. As a company trying to promote a product, I would stay as far away from that memory as possible, at least if you care about international markets.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46787165"&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46787165&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be wild speculation about freedom of speech rights or hacking Signal.&lt;p&gt;The FBI simply joined groupchats and read them. This is trivial stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
