<item xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"><title>[2025-08-01] New comment by nicoburns in "I tried Servo"</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;&gt; The current roadmap lists Shadow DOM and CSS Grid as priorities&lt;p&gt;I've been working on the CSS Grid support. About to land "named grid lines and areas" support which should make a bunch more websites layout correctly.&lt;p&gt;I'm biased because it's my project, but IMO the approach Servo is using for CSS Grid is pretty cool in that the actual implementation is in an external library (Taffy [0]) that can be used standalone and is widely used accross the Rust UI ecosystem, including in the Blitz [1] web engine (which also uses Taffy for Flexbox and Block layout), the Zed [2] text editor, and the Bevy [3] game engine.&lt;p&gt;I'm hopeful that this approach of breaking down a web engine into independently usable modules with public APIs (which builds upon Servo's earlier work on modular libraries such as Stylo and html5ever) will make it easier for people to get involved in web engine development (as they can understand each piece in isolation), and make it easier for people to create new web engines in future (as they won't have to start completely from scratch).&lt;p&gt;[0]: &lt;a href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy"&gt;https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not default to assuming it was his competitors, that sounds like scapegoating to deflect responsibility. What most likely happened is his site was scanned by one of the increasingly sophisticated exploit crawlers (anyone who runs an internet facing site and can view traffic knows what I'm talking about). His site got flagged as vulnerable, the hacker found out it was built like swiss cheese and had fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just want to say how much I thank YCom for not f'ing up the HN interface, and keeping it fast.&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember when Slashdot committed suicide. They had an interface that was very easy for me to scan and find high value comments, and in the name of "modern UI" or some other nonsense needed to keep a few designers employed, completely revamped it so that it had a ton of whitespace and made it basically impossible for me to skim the comments.&lt;p&gt;I think I tried it for about 3 days before I gave up, and I was a daily Slashdot reader before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; So the ancient mystery of why we need sleep might have just been answered.&lt;p&gt;I would be very surprised if sleep would serve only one purpose. In complex interconnected systems you usually don't get far with monocausal explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An underrated quality of LLMs as study partner is that you can ask "stupid" questions without fear of embarrassment. Adding in a mode that doesn't just dump an answer but works to take you through the material step-by-step is magical. A tireless, capable, well-versed assistant on call 24/7 is an autodidact's dream.&lt;p&gt;I'm puzzled (but not surprised) by the standard HN resistance &amp; skepticism. Learning something online 5 years ago often involved trawling incorrect, outdated or hostile content and attempting to piece together mental models without the chance to receive immediate feedback on intuition or ask follow up questions. This is leaps and bounds ahead of that experience.&lt;p&gt;Should we trust the information at face value without verifying from other sources? Of course not, that's part of the learning process. Will some (most?) people rely on it lazily without using it effectively? Certainly, and this technology won't help or hinder them any more than a good old fashioned textbook.&lt;p&gt;Personally I'm over the moon to be living at a time where we have access to incredible tools like this, and I'm impressed with the speed at which they're improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll personally attest: LLM's have been absolutely incredible to self learn new things post graduation. It used to be that if you got stuck on a concept, you're basically screwed. Unless it was common enough to show up in a well formed question on stack exchange, it was pretty much impossible, and the only thing you can really do is keep paving forward and hope at some point, it'll make sense to you.&lt;p&gt;Now, everyone basically has a personal TA, ready to go at all hours of the day.&lt;p&gt;I get the commentary that it makes learning too easy or shallow, but I doubt anyone would think that college students would learn better if we got rid of TA's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone still need testimonies like these to be convinced that Israel is systematically exterminating the Palestinians using kinetic force and starvation? We're past that point now. Making Gaza unlivable by carpet-bombing the strip, telegraphing mass murder in unambiguous statements at the highest levels of government, dehumanizing the Palestinians and silencing anyone who dares to speak up?&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am thankful this hasn't been taken down like any article remotely critical of Israel.&lt;p&gt;And this has eliminated the whole Western bullshit about human rights maximalism - it's just the same damn thing every time. Like the atrocities in the Congo free State, the Scramble for Africa, etc. the West will sponsor unspeakable atrocities overseas and then act shocked when they actually happen.&lt;p&gt;Many people in the West don't realize it, but Palestine will wreck severe damage on the West. Just like Gorbachev visiting a random store in the US and seeing insane abundance in a shop in the middle of nowhere while Soviet citizens starved, what killed the Soviet Union was disillusion; people at all levels realized that a system that couldn't provide its people the basics didn't deserve to exist.&lt;p&gt;That's what happening in the West: American GWOT veterans are still feeling disillusioned about what they went to do in Iraq &amp; Afg. (and Vietnam, before it), and now their kids are seriously asking, "Are we the baddies?"&lt;p&gt;What's the point of this industrial capacity and wealth if all we do with it is bomb kids? No political system can survive disillusion, that is, the point where people across the spectrum start seeing their nation as hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm probably not going to hit the weekly limit, but it makes me nervous that the limit is weekly as opposed to every 36 hours or something. If I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; hit the limit, that's it for the &lt;i&gt;entire week&lt;/i&gt;—a long time to be without a tool I've grown accustomed to!&lt;p&gt;I feel like someone is going to reply that I'm too reliant on Claude or something. Maybe that's true, but I'd feel the same about the prospect of loosing ripgrep for a week, or whatever. Loosing it for a couple of days is more palatable.&lt;p&gt;Also, I find it notable they said this will affect "less than 5% of users". I'm used to these types of announcements claiming they'll affect less than 1%. Anthropic is saying that one out of every 20 users will hit the new limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's crazy that we live in a world where maybe a few dozen people's weird ideas about what shouldn't be allowed can cause payment processors to pressure the storefronts to delist the titles. It is censorship of something they personally find distasteful. guess what: nobody is forcing you to play weird art games about trauma.&lt;p&gt;obviously we must keep the pressure up on payment processors to reverse course, but we also need to push back against people in society who think they can decide what other adults are allowed to do on their own time. If folks IRL have weird ideas pushed back on IRL we wouldn't get to crisis points like this.&lt;/p&gt;

Then he begins downloading the file - which only progresses to the point it had been uploaded, and subsequently stalls indefinitely. And, finally, he finishes uploading the file (which gracefully resumes) and the file download (which is still running) seamlessly completes.&lt;p&gt;I found that particularly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is becoming increasingly authoritarian in ways that feel increasingly antagonistic to the majority of the population, regardless of political party. Taxes are rising (with tax take falling), crimes are going unchecked, just mentioning increased immigration gets a lot of people's backs up, but as GDP per capita continues to stall and even fall, the pressure it puts on services is a factor for many. And we're seeing those with a few quid to rub together leave, but as long as those people leaving are straight, white males, or their families, they're being told "good riddance" regardless of the brain drain and loss of tax income.&lt;p&gt;On the NHS, I tried for years to push for improvements to switch to digital cancer screening invitations after they missed my mother (offering to build the software for free), which is now happening, but suggesting the NHS isn't perfect is against the religion here. My sister who works in NHS DEI hasn't spoken to me since publishing a book on it.&lt;p&gt;Every time someone with the finances, vision and ability leaves I think the situation gets a little bit worse, it increases the proportion of people remaining willing to put up with all of it. Anecdotally, many of my friends have already left, some of the older generation want to leave but feel tied in. My flight out is in 6 weeks. Good riddance, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically every new law, piece of news or media I see coming from the UK paints a picture of a beat-down, cynical &amp; scared society that's complacent to or in support of increasing surveillance and control by the government. Like maybe Adolescence or basically any mention of the NHS. The crimes they cite like child grooming or terrorism/hate being incited sound pretty terrible too, but I wonder why the UK specifically is taking action - is the issue bigger there, or are they just more aware of and willing to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Device security checks" is the most horrifying aspect as it basically means "officially sanctioned hardware and software", and leads straight into the dystopia that Stallman warned us about in &lt;i&gt;Right to Read&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;There is some amusing irony in the EU relying on the US for furthering its own authoritarianism. It's unfortunate that freedom (in the classic rebellious, American sense) never became that popular in the EU, or for that matter, the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's amazing the impact that the reintroduction has had. On a recent winter trip there I also learned that the reintroduction literally moved rivers [1]:&lt;p&gt;- Elk quit loitering along streams, so willow and cottonwood shot up, anchoring soil and narrowing channels.&lt;p&gt;- The new woody growth gave beavers lumber; their colonies jumped from one in 1996 to a dozen within fifteen years, raising water tables and rebuilding wetlands.&lt;p&gt;- With healthier riparian zones came deeper pools, colder water, and a surge in native trout and song-bird nests.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-02-predators-ecosystems-yellowstone-wolves-carnivores.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://phys.org/news/2025-02-predators-ecosystems-yellowsto...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At AutoTempest we resisted making an app for years, because anything that a hypothetical app could do, we could do with the website. And in my opinion, when searching for cars, it's more convenient to be in your browser where you can easily open new tabs, bookmark results, etc.&lt;p&gt;And for years, it was our most requested feature, by far. We had instructions for how to pin the site to your home screen, and would explain to users how the website does everything an app can do. Still, constant requests for an app. Finally we relented and released one, and very quickly around half our mobile traffic moved to the app without us really trying to nudge people at all.&lt;p&gt;People just really like apps! I think it suits our mental model of different tools for different uses. We've also found that app users are much more engaged than website users, but of course much of that will be selection bias. Still, I can see how having your app on someone's home screen could provide a significant boost to retention, compared to a website they're liable to forget.

&lt;p&gt;At AutoTempest we resisted making an app for years, because anything that a hypothetical app could do, we could do with the website. And in my opinion, when searching for cars, it's more convenient to be in your browser where you can easily open new tabs, bookmark results, etc.&lt;p&gt;And for years, it was our most requested feature, by far. We had instructions for how to pin the site to your home screen, and would explain to users how the website does everything an app can do. Still, constant requests for an app. Finally we relented and released one, and very quickly around half our mobile traffic moved to the app without us really trying to nudge people at all.&lt;p&gt;People just really like apps! I think it suits our mental model of different tools for different uses. We've also found that app users are much more engaged than website users, but of course much of that will be selection bias. Still, I can see how having your app on someone's home screen could provide a significant boost to retention, compared to a website they're liable to forget. For us now, that's the main benefit we see. Certainly don't use any additional data, though I won't argue that other companies don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot agree more and this has always been a pet peeve of mine.&lt;p&gt;Most native apps are some half gig large where even the heaviest website is a few mb. They dont let you highlight text and have other bizarre design choices. Even worse, they request importing contacts list which isnt even an option on the web.&lt;p&gt;Native apps could be butter but more often than not they are like margarine. Smooth, oily, and not good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPAs make sense when your users have long sessions in your app. When it is worth the pain to load a large bundle in exchange for having really small network requests after the load.&lt;p&gt;Smooth transitions are a nice side effect, but not the reason for an SPA. The core argument of the article, that client-side routing is a solution for page transitions, is a complete misunderstanding of what problems SPAs solve. So absolutely, if you shared that misunderstanding of SPAs and used them to solve the wrong problem, this article is 100% correct.&lt;p&gt;But SPAs came about in the days of jQuery, not React. You'd have a complex app, and load up a giant pile of jQuery spaghetti, which would then treat each div of your app is its own little mini-app, with lots of small network requests keeping everything in sync. It solved a real problem, of not wanting to reload all that code every time a user on an old browser, with a slow connection, changed some data. jQuery made it feasible to do SPAs instead.&lt;p&gt;Later, React and other frameworks made it less spaghetti-like. And it really took off. Often, for sketchy reasons. But the strongest argument for SPAs remains using them as a solution to provide a single-load of a large code bundle, that can be cached, to provide minimal network traffic subsequent to the load when the expected session time of a user is long enough to be worth the trouble of the complexity of an SPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story has been reposted many times, and I think GJS's remarks (as recorded by Andy Wingo) are super-interesting as always, but this is really not a great account of "why MIT switched from Scheme to Python."&lt;p&gt;Source: I worked with GJS (I also know Alexey and have met Andy Wingo), and I took 6.001, my current research still has us referring to SICP on a regular basis, and in 2006 Kaijen Hsiao and I were the TAs for what was &lt;i&gt;basically&lt;/i&gt; the first offering of the class that quasi-replaced it (6.01) taught by Leslie Kaelbling, Hal Abelson, and Jacob White.&lt;p&gt;I would defer to lots of people who know the story better than me, but here's my understanding of the history. When the MIT EECS intro curriculum was redesigned in the 1980s, there was a theory that an EECS education should start with four "deep dives" into the four "languages of engineering." There were four 15-unit courses, each about one of these "languages":&lt;p&gt;- 6.001: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (the "procedural" language, led by Abelson and Sussman)&lt;p&gt;- 6.002: Circuits and Electronics ("structural" language)&lt;p&gt;- 6.003: Signals and Systems ("functional" language)&lt;p&gt;- 6.004: Computation Structures ("architectural" language)&lt;p&gt;These were intellectually deep classes, although there was pain in them, and they weren't universally beloved. 6.001 wasn't really &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; Scheme; I think a lot of the point of using Scheme (as I understood it) is that the language is so minimalist and so beautiful that even this first intro course can be &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; fundamental concepts of computer science without getting distracted by the language. This intro sequence lasted until the mid-2000s, when enrollment in EECS ("Course 6") declined after the dot-com crash, and (as would be expected, and I think particularly worrisome) the enrollment drop was greater among demographic groups that EECS was eager to retain. My understanding circa 2005 is that there was a view that EECS had broadened in its applications, and that beginning the curriculum with four "deep dives" was offputting to students who might not be as sure that they wanted to pursue EECS and might not be aware of all the cool places they could go with that education (e.g. to robotics, graphics, biomedical applications, genomics, computer vision, NLP, systems, databases, visualization, networking, HCI, ...).&lt;p&gt;I wasn't in the room where these decisions were made, and I bet there were multiple motivations for these changes, but I understood that was part of the thinking. As a result, the EECS curriculum was redesigned circa 2005-7 to de-emphasize the four 15-unit "deep dives" and replace them with two 12-unit survey courses, each one a survey of a bunch of cool places that EECS could go. The "6.01" course (led by Kaelbling, Abelson, and White) was about robots, control, sensing, statistics, probabilistic inference, etc., and students did projects where the robot drove around a maze (starting from an unknown position) and sensed the walls with little sonar sensors and did Bayesian inference to figure out its structure and where it was. The "6.02" course was about communication, information, compression, networking, etc., and eventually the students were supposed to each get a software radio and build a Wi-Fi-like system (the software radios proved difficult and, much later, I helped make this an acoustic modem project).&lt;p&gt;The goal of these classes (as I understood) was to expose students to a broad range of all the cool stuff that EECS could do and to let them get there sooner (e.g. two classes instead of four) -- keep in mind this was in the wake of the dot-com crash when a lot of people were telling students that if they majored in computer science, they were going to end up programming for an insurance company at a cubicle farm before their job was inevitably outsourced to a low-cost-of-living country.&lt;p&gt;6.01 used Python, but in a very different way than 6.001 "used" Scheme -- my recollection is that the programming work in 6.01 (at least circa 2006) was minimal and was only to, e.g., implement short programs that drove the robot and averaged readings from its sonar sensors and made steering decisions or inferred the robot location. It was nothing like the big programming projects in 6.001 (the OOP virtual world, the metacircular evaluator, etc.).&lt;p&gt;So I don't think it really captures it to say that MIT "switched from Scheme to Python" -- I think the MIT EECS intro sequence switched from four deep-dive classes to two survey ones, and while the first "deep dive" course (6.001) had included a lot of programming, the first of the new survey courses only had students write pretty small programs (e.g. "drive the robot and maintain equal distance between the two walls") where the simplest thing was to use a scripting language where the small amount of necessary information can be taught by example. But it's not like the students &lt;i&gt;learned&lt;/i&gt; Python in that class.&lt;p&gt;My (less present) understanding is that &gt;a decade after this 2006-era curricular change, the department has largely deprecated the idea of an EECS core curriculum, and MIT CS undergrads now go through something closer to a conventional CS0/CS1 sequence, similar to other CS departments around the country (&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/changes-to-6-100a-b-l/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.eecs.mit.edu/changes-to-6-100a-b-l/&lt;/a&gt;). But all of that is long after the change that Sussman and Wingo are talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;

But it's not like the students &lt;i&gt;learned&lt;/i&gt; Python in that class.&lt;p&gt;My (less present) understanding is that &gt;a decade after this 2006-era curricular change, the department has largely deprecated the idea of an EECS core curriculum, and MIT CS undergrads now go through something closer to a conventional CS0/CS1 sequence, similar to other CS departments around the country (&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/changes-to-6-100a-b-l/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.eecs.mit.edu/changes-to-6-100a-b-l/&lt;/a&gt;). But all of that is long after the change that Sussman and Wingo are talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story has been reposted many times, and I think GJS's remarks (as recorded by Andy Wingo) are super-interesting as always, but this is really not a great account of "why MIT switched from Scheme to Python."&lt;p&gt;Source: I worked with GJS (I also know Alexey and have met Andy Wingo), and I took 6.001, my current research still has us referring to SICP on a regular basis, and in 2006 Kaijen Hsiao and I were the TAs for what was &lt;i&gt;basically&lt;/i&gt; the first offering of the class that quasi-replaced it (6.01) taught by Leslie Kaelbling, Hal Abelson, and Jacob White.&lt;p&gt;I would defer to lots of people who know the story better than me, but here's my understanding of the history. When the MIT EECS intro curriculum was redesigned in the 1980s, there was a theory that an EECS education should start with four "deep dives" into the four "languages of engineering." There were four 15-unit courses, each about one of these "languages":&lt;p&gt;- 6.001: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (the "procedural" language, led by Abelson and Sussman)&lt;p&gt;- 6.002: Circuits and Electronics ("structural" language)&lt;p&gt;- 6.003: Signals and Systems ("functional" language)&lt;p&gt;- 6.004: Computation Structures ("architectural" language)&lt;p&gt;These were intellectually deep classes, although there was pain in them, and they weren't universally beloved. 6.001 wasn't really &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; Scheme; I think a lot of the point of using Scheme (as I understood it) is that the language is so minimalist and so beautiful that even this first intro course can be &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; fundamental concepts of computer science without getting distracted by the language. This intro sequence lasted until the mid-2000s, when enrollment in EECS ("Course 6") declined after the dot-com crash, and (as would be expected, and I think particularly worrisome) the enrollment drop was greater among demographic groups that EECS was eager to retain. My understanding circa 2005 is that there was a view that EECS had broadened in its applications, and that beginning the curriculum with four "deep dives" was offputting to students who might not be as sure that they wanted to pursue EECS and might not be aware of all the cool places they could go with that education (e.g. to robotics, graphics, biomedical applications, genomics, computer vision, NLP, systems, databases, visualization, networking, HCI, ...).&lt;p&gt;I wasn't in the room where these decisions were made, and I bet there were multiple motivations for these changes, but I understood that was part of the thinking. As a result, the EECS curriculum was redesigned circa 2005-7 to de-emphasize the four 15-unit "deep dives" and replace them with two 12-unit survey courses, each one a survey of a bunch of cool places that EECS could go. The "6.01" course (led by Kaelbling, Abelson, and White) was about robots, control, sensing, statistics, probabilistic inference, etc., and students did projects where the robot drove around a maze (starting from an unknown position) and sensed the walls with little sonar sensors and did Bayesian inference to figure out its structure and where it was. The "6.02" course was about communication, information, compression, networking, etc., and eventually the students were supposed to each get a software radio and build a Wi-Fi-like system (the software radios proved difficult and, much later, I helped make this an acoustic modem project).&lt;p&gt;The goal of these classes (as I understood) was to expose students to a broad range of all the cool stuff that EECS could do and to let them get there sooner (e.g. two classes instead of four) -- keep in mind this was in the wake of the dot-com crash when a lot of people were telling students that if they majored in computer science, they were going to end up programming for an insurance company at a cubicle farm before their job was inevitably outsourced to a low-cost-of-living country.&lt;p&gt;6.01 used Python, but in a very different way than 6.001 "used" Scheme -- my recollection is that the programming work in 6.01 (at least circa 2006) was minimal and was only to, e.g., implement short programs that drove the robot and averaged readings from its sonar sensors and made steering decisions or inferred the robot location.

&lt;p&gt;I just installed Graphene on a new pixel. I've only used it for two days, but I got that same feeling of "finding buried treasure in your backyard" I got when I first installed Linux in 1999. I can't believe this amazing software is free in all senses of the word. It is a TON of work and they got so much right. The security and usability settings give all the grainular control I've known was possible and wanted for a long time.&lt;p&gt;I see some core team on this thread, so just wanted to say THANK YOU! Awesome job! Keep fighting for the users!&lt;p&gt;I'm totally the wrong person to offer recommendations on mobile, but so far it works very well for me, but then, I use almost no third party apps, and none of them are Play store only.  My only complaint is the hardware (outside of their control).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil central bank introduced Pix a few years ago. It took over the country as the public basic infrastructure for money transfer. Totally free and instantaneous transactions between people and companies, available to all banks.&lt;p&gt;Then, just last week, the US presidency launched an investigation considering Pix an unfair trade practice against the US.&lt;p&gt;Actions like that may show the current direction of the US government is aligned on preserving status quo. But still, I wonder how impactful a public digital infrastructure for the dollar would be.&lt;/p&gt;
